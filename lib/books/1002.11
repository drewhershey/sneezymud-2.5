AFFECTION FLAGS/SPELL AFFECTS (mob/obj files)

  This is a bitvector that indicates what the monster is affected by.
  Puff could for example be able to "detect invisible" or maybe
  "sanctuary" (1/2 damage). A lot of these bits are meant for players
  only (in a context with a spell), and should NOT be used when indicated.
  Also, these same numbers are used again for spell_affects on objects.
  (See object listing below for more detail.)

  The bits are:
  AFF_BLIND             1         the monster is blinded.
  AFF_INVISIBLE         2         The monster is invisible.
  AFF_DETECT_EVIL       4         Monster will see (red auras)
  AFF_DETECT_INVISIBLE  8         The monster can see invisible things.
                                  (Especially good for aggressive npc's)
  AFF_DETECT_MAGIC      16        Monster will see (blue glows) on obj: MAGIC
  AFF_SENSE_LIFE        32        Monster has sense life cast on it.
                                  Possibly of use for objs, why on a mob?
  AFF_SANCTUARY         128       The monster has sanctuary (1/2 damage)
                                  Special permission required if on obj.
  AFF_FLYING            2048      monster can fly.
  AFF_PROT_EVIL         8192      Monster receives less damage from evil things
                                  1(?) point less damage.  does this work?)
  AFF_PARALYSIS         16384     paralyzed.  Why would you set this?
                                  the ultimate cursed object?
  AFF_INFRAVISION       32768     the monster can see in the dark.
  AFF_WATER_BREATH      65536     monster can breath underwater and move about.
  AFF_SNEAK             524288    The message "The xxx leaves direction" will
                                  not be displayed when the monster moves
                                  out/in to a room.
  AFF_HIDE              1048576   The monster will be hidden, and can only
                                  be detected by a "sense life" spell
  AFF_PROT_GOOD         2097152   Similar to PROT_EVIL.
  AFF_CHARM             4194304   The monster will act as charmed when a
                                  "follow <player>" is entered. Note that
                                  players can't force monsters to follow
                                  them.
  AFF_TRUE_SIGHT        33554432  The monster can see all things in the dark.
  AFF_FIRESHIELD        134217728 Mob has fireshield around it.  Way too
                                  powerful for an object.
  AFF_SILENT            268435456 Mob is silenced (no speak, no shout, etc.)
                                  Spell casting can occur.

for the sake of completeness, here's the missing ones.  Please don't set any
of these, they have no purpose on a mob or on an object  (see Lord of Worlds
if you have a question on this)
