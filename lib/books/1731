   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
A. Some of the entries look like these:
Anaconda- Anacondas don't want "none" unless you've got buns, hun'.
Aphrodesiac- For some reason, females seem to really like a good aphrodesiac.
   You should try some sometime... you may be surprised!
