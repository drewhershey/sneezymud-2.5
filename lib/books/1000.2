EXPLANATION OF WORLD FILE FIELDS:

#<virtual number> is:
  A number for the given room. No two rooms may have the same number.
  The <virtual number> must always increase when browsing down the
  world file (but increments can be larger than one).

<name> <!NL> ~ <NL>:
  This name is the "title" of the room. This title is also used in special
  procedures like:
    "exits"
    "brief mode"

<description> <NL> ~ <NL>:
  This is the general description of the room.
<zone nr> <!NL> is:
  The number of the zone in which this room is located. This number is used
  for resetting zones and monster zone movement. See the zone file.

<room_flags> <!NL>  are:
  This is a bitvector.  See Room Flags appendix for values.
  Bitvectors are added to achieve multiple affects.  i.e.  NO_MOB (=4) and
  PEACEFUL (=16) would get a room flag number of 20 (=4+16)

<sector_type> <NL> is:
  This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
  a location of the type - use one of the numbers 0..7 (they are NOT the
  movement-points used - merely indexes to a lookup-table):
  See Sector Types Appendix for values.

D<Exit number> <NL> is one of:
  0 = North
  1 = East
  2 = South
  3 = West
  4 = Up
  5 = Down

<general description><NL>~<NL>:
  What a player will see if he types 'look <direction>'

<keyword list>~<NL>:
  used for commands like 'open', 'close', etc. should be 'door' for ordinary
  doors. Example: An exit from a given room leads through a cupboard. The
  keyword list for this exit might look like this:

  "cupboard door~"

<Door flag> <!NL>

  If <Door Flag> is 1, lock/unlock/open/close/pick/doorbash will work on exit.
  If it is 2, the exit can only be locked/unlocked/opened/closed.
  If it is 3, it is like 1 but is SECRET.
  If it is 4, it is like 2 but is SECRET.
  If it is 0, these commands won't work. (The exit can still be closed at
  reset, however; maybe to be opened by some special routine, like a concealed
  handle).

  The state of the doors after reset may be controlled by a command in the
  reset-command table (see the zone file). The initial state of a door is
  open.

<Key Number> <!NL>:
  The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door (in the direction
  given). If a player carries/holds this object, he can lock/unlock.
  <Key Number> == -1 means no keyhole. If <Door flag> is 0, the value of this
  field is ignored.

<to_room> <NL>:
  The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this number is
  -1 (NOWHERE), the exit doesn't lead anywhere. This might be useful for
  adding an exit-description in a direction which doesn't actually lead
  anywhere.

** Note about doors. You must make a door in both rooms that the door
                     is set between.

Extra descriptions:
------------------

<blank separated keyword list> <!NL> ~ <NL> is:
  A list of the keywords that will allow the extra description to be
  displayed. The keywords must must be seperated by blanks.

<description> <NL> ~ <NL>:
  The description that is show when a player types 'look at <keyword>'
  and keyword matches one of the above.
