   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
L. Some of the entries look like these:
Lamia- for some reason, these rather noisy and annoying creatures seem to hang
   out in Old Thalos in large numbers.
Light source- for some reason, these always seem to expire right after you flee
   so you do not have any idea where you are or how to get out.
