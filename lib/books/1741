   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
K. Some of the entries look like these:
Kanga-Roo, Captain- leader of the Roo forces in their fued against their hated
   enemies, the Aborigines. Fortunately, the Aborigine Chief is just as inept
   or else the war would have ended in defeat for the Roos.
Knife- a very useful invention, the knife helps us in many ways. When one is
   done with a knife, it is also discovered that it fits nicely in someone's
   back. [See "Friend" in vol. F]
