   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
V. Some of the entries look like these:
Vampire- these bloodsuckers are pure evil and tend to ruin a person's day
   (or night rather) whenever they feel hungry.
Vorpal Sword- a kind of nifty sword, when properly made, these swords can do
   quite a fair amount of damage.
