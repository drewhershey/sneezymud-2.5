          no lockability.

          occupy fraction of volume depending on material type.

All carryable bags (anything a player can pick up and take with him) must
be actual_vol = 1, the reason is that bags expand from their initial actual_vol
as stuff is put in.  This makes no sense for chests, so we set them non_TAKE.
