   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
H. Some of the entries look like these:
Humans- while good in a fight, they just lack the concentration for serious
   study of most other disciplines.
Halberd- if you have the strength for one, a halberd is a fairly sturdy weapon
   with fairly decent damage and medium upkeep.
