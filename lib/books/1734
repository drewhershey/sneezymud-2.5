   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
D. Some of the entries look like these:
Dracolich- often underrated (at least recently), the dracolich is quite deadly
   to even powerful opponents.
Dice, fuzzy- often seen hanging from the top of various "mounts" these cute
   little things are quite soft and warm.
