   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
X. Some of the entries look like these:
Xenia, the Silver Dragon- quite large and ancient, this dragon hangs out in the
   frozen wastelands of Artica.
Xylophone- this unusual instrument allows one to fine tune other musical
   instruments and to play all sorts of music as it can range from very high
   notes to very low ones.
