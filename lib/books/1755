   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
Y. Some of the entries look like these:
Yochlol, Handmaiden of Lolth- these rather disgusting females have this strange
   empathy with spiders. They have been known to even pick them up and pet even
   the dangerous ones! (perhaps you should give them a Black Flag spider-killer
   for a present; they are sure to show you their appreciation)
Yellow tulip- for some unknown reason, holding this pretty little flower helps
   somone remain unnoticed by people who are looking around.
