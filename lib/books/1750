   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
T. Some of the entries look like these:
Tasmanian Devil- a rather nasty and viscious beast, it was captured by several
   Roo soldiers by order of their queen. They had hoped that they could train
   it to kill the Aborigines, but they have had no success. It is currently
   kept in a locked cage for which the queen has the only key.
Two-handed sword- large and heavy, very few people are able to wield it. Those
   that can, however, find it to be a fairly useful and damaging weapon.
