   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
R. Some of the entries look like these:
Rat- there are many varieties of rat (flying, sewer, wererat, ...) you will
   also discover that while not all, a few are good eatin' if you cook them
   properly (the radioactive rats are sought by the best chefs).
Rapier- a useful weapon, it can really help get your point across if you get
   in an argument.
