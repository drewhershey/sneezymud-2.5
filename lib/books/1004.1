ITEM_LIGHT (1)
Value[0]: Not Used
Value[1]: Not Used
Value[2]: Number of hours the light can be used for. Zero hours means that
          the light has gone out. A negative number will create an eternal
          light source.
Value[3]: Not Used

Avoid any more permanent light sources.  Nothing should last forever,
especially perm light with other affects too... 

Lights with hours of use should be set to decay after about 1.5 - 2.5* their
useful hour.  Hence a lamp that "burns" for 50 ticks, should decay in 75 to
125 ticks.  This is especially true of lights that have bonus affects since
you get the bonus affect even if it has "no light"
