   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
U. Some of the entries look like these:
Unicorn- these horny horses only go for those that are pure good. Most people,
   however, do not want to admit that these steeds will let them ride.
Ukelele- a kind of small guitar, most serious muscians don't consider this
   instrument a real instrument for entertaining anyone except children.
