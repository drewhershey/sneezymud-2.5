   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
N. Some of the entries look like these:
Nomad- talk about crazy, these people seem to get some sort of thrill out of
   living in a hot, dry place with little water. At least some carry money.
Nail- useful in construction, these small pieces of metal can also be used to
   nail someone to the wall.
