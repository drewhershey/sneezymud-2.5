          The above values for drunkness/fullness/thirst are used per
          four "units" drunk. The values are expressed in HOURS!
          Example:
            Dragon empties a bottle (say 7 units) of saltwater.
            His Drunkness is not changed ((7/4)*0)
            His Fullness increases by ((7/4)*1) hours
            His Thirst increases by ((7/4)*-2) hours, thus making
               him More thirsty.

          The hours above are numbers between 0 and 24. 24 hours is
          maximum for drunkness/fullness/thirst. When hours are zero
          for any drunkness/fullness/thirst the person will be
          sober, hungry, or thirsty respectively.

Value[3]: if this value is non-zero, then the drink is poisoned.

In general, 1 sip = 500 cu. in. and 1 sip = 2 lb's
