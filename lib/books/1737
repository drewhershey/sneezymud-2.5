   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
G. Some of the entries look like these:
Golem- there are so many variaties of golems that it would be impossible to
   name them all... in fact, more are being made today than ever before!
Gold- for some reason, this soft metal has a high value though one would wonder
   why since you can't even make a decent weapon out of it.
