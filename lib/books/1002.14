OBJECTS rules of thumb

The best item of a given type (held, wielded, about, shield, etc.) in
"existance" is reserved as a quest prize (a DIFFICULT quest!).  One step down
from that are the skexie prizes.  Below that are the leveled items.  Please
don't make items better then the skexie prizes to exist naturally in the game.
Feel free to design any item you want as a reward for a quest. (quests with
"new equipment" as prizes should probably get approval through the Lord
of Worlds esp. since he needs to add it to the data base)

hitndam items:  such items should have virtually no other benefits on them.
a +1 +1 item is ok by itself.  A +2 +2 needs at least one detrimental affect
as well.  +3:(2)  +4(3 minimum and they better be biggies)
          +5:(should essentially kill you out right for using it)
   detriments include: level restrictions, anti-class, anti-alignment,
       bad armor, bad saves, etc.

bags and containers:  also, please avoid bigger, better carrying objects.
there are PLENTY in the game and currently the opinion is that far too much
shit is being ported around.

keys and lockable containers:  set keys unrentable (rent = -1).  All such
objects should get this added at bottom of that object:
E
opens_door_(direction)_(room number)~
~
Alternatively, opens_chest_(chest vnum) or opened_by_key_(key vnum).
This is so gods can stat the object and find out what the key opens or
what key opens the object quickly.  Note, this provides no useful
information to mortals as it is the NAME field of the extra desc that
has text.
