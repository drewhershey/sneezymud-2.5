Welcome to Batopr's Lectures on how to create a zone file.  First off, yes,
you can use instazone to do this, however, problems result if:
any of your mobs are non-sentinels.
you use items/mobs from areas other then your own.
you forget about something. (closeing, locking doors etc.)
Instazone also doesn't let you set fun things like reset time and zone
name.

Secondly, I (or Lord of Worlds) have a more expanded copy of making .zon
file.  But it is written in diku-ese (lots of stuff implementors might
need to know, but area creators don't) and the .zon stuff is crammed into
the middle of .obj, .mob and .wld files so seems cluttered.  You're welcome
to it, but I think what's below is more helpful  :)

Thirdly, this assumes that you have allready created your world file
(on-line EDIT), mob and obj files.  Zone is the last step.
