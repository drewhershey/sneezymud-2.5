   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
Q. Some of the entries look like these:
Quickling- these annoying little faeries must be on drugs! Nothing normal in
   this world would move as fast as they do if they weren't on speed.
Quickness, Sword of- even if you are not so quick (checked your intelligence
   recently?), this sword will help quicken your speed in combat.
