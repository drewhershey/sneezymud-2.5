   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
W. Some of the entries look like these:
Wolf- these guys are just big puppies gone bad. Now they attack almost anyone
   on sight just because they had a bad day.
Whip, snake_headed- used by those silly drow priestesses; the larger ones can
   do a decent amount of damage thought they have a detrimental affect on the
   wielder.
