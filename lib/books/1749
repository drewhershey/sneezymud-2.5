   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
S. Some of the entries look like these:
Shark- they are waiting for you with big, nasty, pointy teeth. They've got a
   mean streak a mile wide!
Sting- not only a popular weapon, Sting also makes a fairly good living as
   a rock musician.
