   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
E. Some of the entries look like these:
Enfan- little child-like creatures... so cute you want to kill them on sight!
Energy bow- these rather "strange" bows don't even shoot anything, people can
  only beat others over the head with them. Despite this, they are highly
  sought after.
