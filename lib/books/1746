   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
P. Some of the entries look like these:
Purple Worm- this large creature lives in the Desert and is always looking for
   something to snack on. Also quite sociable, he is often known to have even
   univited visitors for lunch.
Pick- a useful tool in digging all of the graves for the people who die a bit
   too often.
