   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
M. Some of the entries look like these:
Mime- these guys must have a serious mental problem! If I ever started acting
   like one of them, I'd pray that someone would kill me!
Musical Instruments- while many types are out there, unfortunately, there are
   just as many people that think that they can use them and couldn't carry
   a tune if it were glued to them and weighed nothing.
