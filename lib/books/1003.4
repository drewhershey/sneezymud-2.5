Note, putting the text in afterward serves as useful documentation.
preceding a command by a * will skip that command ( *M 0 1021 ...).
Also see how they set the shopkeeper items maxexist high so he will virtually
always reload with the item even if he has been killed.
If you've set an item [rare] in .obj (value > 2mill) then the total number of
that items (in rent or in the game) will = max_exist.  You want 3 Staff's of
Baelzebub, set max to 3 and value to 200K.

IMPORANT: if you use mobs/objs from other areas, please make a note of it.
otherwise resets for the two areas using it get screwed up. This is really only
vital if your zone is lower then the "normal" area they are supposed to load.
i.e. for shire stuff, only if your zone is using virtual world numbers in
0-1000 range.  If you don't understand this, and have a low number zone, ask
your lord of worlds.
