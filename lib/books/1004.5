For determining level restriction on a weapon:
compute average damage item does (add in +dam affects too).  (6d6=21, 4d5=12...)
determine damage type (slash/blunt or pierce) (backstab vs. non bs weapon)
compare to this table:
                        pierce          blunt/slash
                        avg dam is:     avg dam is:
no level                < 10.5          <11
LEVEL10                 10.5, 11        11 - 13.5
LEVEL15                 (no criteria)   14 - 16.5
LEVEL20                 11.5, 12        17 - 20.5
LEVEL25                 (no criteria)   21 - 22.5
LEVEL30                 12.5, 13        23 - 24.5
LEVEL35                 13.5, 14        25 - 25.5
LEVEL40                 14.5 +          26 +

examples: jeweled dagger (pierce:3d5+2 = 11) gets 10 flag, ancients sword
(slash: 6d6+2=23) gets 30 flag.  warhammer (blunt: 1d5+0 = 3) gets no flag.
This is MINIMUM flag that should be put on it.  If extra affects (enchantable
weapon, casts weapon spells, etc) then increase it appropriately.

Hammers, swords, maces, whips all run about 2000 cu. in.  add about 3-600 for
"large" "long" "huge" items, and subtract off an equivalent amount for
"short" "small"
Daggers (10 in. long) might be 200 cu. in.
2 handed stuff is generally a bit longer and larger then the 1 handed variety.
  2 handed swords should be 3500 cu. in.

Use some sense in weapon creation.  More damage = bigger weapon = heaviery.
