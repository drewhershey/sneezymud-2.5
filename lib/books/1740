   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
J. Some of the entries look like these:
Jugglernaut- this stupid oaf couldn't juggle two items, let alone the several
   that he tries to toss around. Fortunately, he gets a large allowance that
   goes to replace the items he is constantly dropping.
Jello pudding pop- a truly wonderful invention, life would just not be the same
   without an occasional one of these.
