   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
O. Some of the entries look like these:
Otyugh- these vile and disgusting creatures live an filth and trash, but why do
   some of them seem to have a more pleasant personality than politicians?
Onyx- another highly valued material, things made of this stuff tend to be
   highly praised until their power is made more realistic.
