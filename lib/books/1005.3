ACTION FLAGS (mob file)

  This bitvector define how the monster behave.  The bits mean:

  ACT_SPEC         1  This means that there is a special programmed C
                      procedure connected to the monster. When this bit
                      is set the monster "function pointer" must be
                      assigned in the "spec_assign.c file.

  ACT_SENTINEL     2  When this bit is set the monster will NOT
                      move around in the world.

  ACT_SCAVENGER    4  When this bit is set, monsters will pick up stuff
                      lying on the ground. It will pick up the most
                      expensive items first.

  ACT_ISNPC        8  RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE

  ACT_NICE_THIEF  16  When this bit is set, a monster will not attack
                      a thief which has been caught in the act of
                      stealing from this monster.

  ACT_AGGRESSIVE  32  When this bit is set, the monster will attack and
                      attempt to kill any player it can get it's claws on.
                      It will not attack players it can't see (for example
                      dark rooms or when player is invisible, unless the
                      monster can detect invisibility)

  ACT_STAY_ZONE   64  When this bit is set, the monster will never move
                      into another zone of the world (this is good for
                      keeping your monsters in your own adventure).

  ACT_WIMPY      128  When this bit is set, the monster will flee when it's
                      getting percentwise low on hitpoints.
                      If the monster is both aggressive and wimpy, then it
                      will only attack players that are NOT awake! (ie. also
                      suffering players).
        here are some more, but they aren't particularly important:

#define ACT_ANNOYING  256  /* MOB is so utterly irritating that other   */
                            /* aggressive monsters will attack it       */
#define ACT_IMMORTAL  2048  /* MOB is a natural event, can't be killed  */
#define ACT_DEADLY    8192  /* MOB has deadly poison .  defunct action  */
#define ACT_MEGA_AGGR32768  /* Mob is aggressive, and can "see thru sneak" */
                            /* mob will also attack other mobs */
