   This book is just packed with creatures and items that begin with the letter
I. Some of the entries look like these:
Ice, Vanilla- an individual with a high opinion of his singing and dancing
   skills who said "Word" to your mother. (personally I'd beat him up)
Ice Boots- these are for people that enjoy getting cold feet (others just seem
   to lose them or something since they disappear after a while).
