EXPLANATION OF FIELDS - MOB FILE

#<virtual number><NL> is:
  The monsters virtual number. Rules are same as for room virtual numbers.

<namelist><!NL>~<NL>
  The space-separated name alias list.

<short description><!NL>~<NL>
  This string will be displayed when the monster take action, for example
  if it is "The Beastly Fido", and fido leaves south the message will be
  "The Beastly Fido leaves south."

<long description><NL>~<NL>
  This description is displayed when the monster is in it's "default"
  position. When not in the default position, a message like:
  "<short description> is sleeping here." could be displayed.

<description><NL>~<NL>
  This will be displayed when a player looks at the monster.

<action flags>[!NL]

  This bitvector define how the monster behave.  See Action Flags Appendix
  for values.

<affection flags>

  This bitvector defines what the mob is affected by.  It also is applyable
  to objects so some vectors will not make sense for mobs.  See
  Affection Flags Appendix for values.

<Alignment Flag>

  This is the monsters alignment, read as:
  +1000 .. +350  Good Alignment
   +349 .. -349  Neutral Alignment
   -350 ..-1000 Evil Alignment

<Detailed/Simple flag/New/multi Attack>  <NL>
   'D' | 'S' | 'N' | 'A'

  'D'  - detailed.. ignore.
  'S'  - standard format (obsolete)
  'N'  - New style mobs
  'A'  - Multi-attack new style mob
  'L'  - New style mob with loudness (and multi attacks if desired)

S and N style monsters have 1 attack a round.  A and L can have more.
To define the number of attacks the creature has per round, add a space
followed by the number of attacks the monster has per round. (1 to 8)
  0 0 0 S    <- old style
  0 0 0 A 3  <- new style monster with 3 attacks per round.
  0 0 0 N    <- new style monster.

<Level> <!NL>
   This is the level of the monster. See "defs.doc" for guidelines when
   setting the level.  A good deal of stuff (saving throws, spell casting
   ability, internal flags used for fighting and xp determination) is
   dependant on level.

<THAC0> <!NL>
   The monsters THAC0. THAC0 is an abbrevation for "To Hit Armour Class Zero".
   TOHIT bonus = (20 - THAC0).  To determine if a hit in combat occurs:
        a d20 is rolled, the attacker's TOHIT bonus is added to this, and the
        defender's AC is subtracted (-10AC is 20off, 0ac is 10off, 10AC is 0off)
        if this total is 11 or greater, a hit has occurred.
        *exception: if the original die roll=1, automatic miss.
        *note: the most TOHIT anyone _needs_ is 30 (thac0 = -10) to
               guarantee a hit.
           2 (worst die roll) + 30 (tohit) - 20 (-100 armor = -10AC) = 12 (HIT!)
        *curse/blind/other spells sometimes lower tohit.  thac0 < -15 is dumb.

<AC>  <!NL>
   The monsters armour class. See "defs.doc" for guidelines regarding
   armour.  Values should be between -10 (tank) and 10 (naked).  Values
   below -10 will act as if = -10; may be useful if mob gets cursed/blind/etc.

<Hit Points>  <!NL>
/***********************************************************************/
//  The following is one area of difference between S and N

-=>S style <=-

   (format is xdy+z where x, y, and z are numbers
   This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has. If this is
   entered into the file:

   ... ... 3d8+10 ...

   the monster will have 10 hitpoints plus the result of rolling 3 dice
   with 8 side, and adding their sum. All the numbers (even zero), the
   plus sign, and the letter 'd' MUST be entered!!! Example:

   ..... 1d6+0 ....

---> N Style <----

   The hit points are determined automatically as Level D 8
   all you have to do is give the bonus #.  Example:

   troll with 6 hd + 7 hit points..

   OLD Style :  6d8+7

   New style :  7   (for the 7 bonus hitpoints) (the level d8 is determined
                    automatically)
   (note:  any mob which has a bonus hitpoint > 500 must be set IMMUNE CHARM
   below to avoid that mob from being resurrected successfully by pc's)

<Damage>  <NL>
   This is the damage a monster will cause when it is using NO weapons
   (the Bare hand damage). The format is exacly like the one described
   for hit points. A thing to note about damage:
   The number after the plus sign, is the "strength bonus". This bonus
   will apply to any weapons used, and bare hands too. Example:

   ..... 1d4+10

   This monster will damage between 11 and 14 hitpoints each round. If the
   monster picks up and wields a tiny stick which give 1d2 damage, then the
   monster will now damage by : 1d2 + 10 points.

before gold, enter a -1  this tells it to expect a RACE at the end of
the line.

<Gold> <!NL>
   The amout of gold carried by the monster.
   SNEEZY: keep this under control until we get a "purpose" for gold again
     since there is no rent currently.

/*****************************  OLD STYLE (S style mobs) **************/
<Exp> <!NL>
   The experience this monster has. Follow guidelines in "def.docs"

/************************** NEW STYLE (N, A, L style mobs) ***************/

<Exp-special bonuses>  <!NL>
   A value from 0 to 10 is plugged in here.  See Experience Appendix for 
   determination of appropriate xp.

<Race> <NL>
   races can be found in Race.h   If you think you need a new race, let
me know, and we can work something out. try to find something that is
fairly close to your race before we add many more.

<position> <!NL>
   This defines the monster's position when loaded into the game.
   A position is one of:

   POSITION_DEAD       0  DO NOT USE
   POSITION_MORTALLYW  1  DO NOT USE
   POSITION_INCAP      2  DO NOT USE

   POSITION_STANDING   8  The monster is standing.

<default position> <!NL>
   This is the position into which the monster will return after
   a fight. This position also defines when the <long description>
   is displayed - see above.

<sex> <NL>
   This is the monsters sex, on of:

   SEX_NEUTRAL   0
   SEX_MALE      1
   SEX_FEMALE    2

*************** New Style Mobs can have resistance/immunity/suscept.  ********

   if your monsters have any resistances, immunities or susceptibilities.

   ADD 3 to the sex.  (neutral = 3, male = 4, female = 5)
   three additional numbers are entered after sex as well.
        Resistance Bitmask , Immunity BitMask, Susceptibility Bitmask
   the values are in Immunity Appendix

   NOTE: any mob in excess of 500 Hit points MUST BE IMMUNE CHARM.

************** Add this ONLY for L style mobs *********************
Type L monsters have two string fields at the end, which are the sound
for the room the monster is in, and the sound for the rooms which the
monster is adjacent to.  for example.. a lamia:

..(deleted stuff)..
8 8 2			<-- The last line (position, default, sex etc)
The lamia howls and shrieks at you
~
You hear a shrieking sound from nearby
