ROOM FLAGS (world file)

  A bitvector consisting of the room conditions as:

  DARK           1  Light must be used to see anything.
  DEATH          2  A player 'dies' (no xp lost) when entering.
                    It is a good idea to:
                     *Have these rooms light, because then EXITS will show
                      the room title, for example "In Boiling Water".
                     *Make exits to all rooms from which one can enter the
                      death_room, then the "death cry" will be heard by
                      other members of the group considering following...
                    CURRENT SNEEZY POLICY FROWNS ON DEATH TRAPS.
  NO_MOB         4  No monsters may walk around in here.  Monsters tracking
                    due to hatred/hunting or for equipment retrieval can
                    enter such a room.
  INDOORS        8  This is inside (a house,cave or dungeon for example).  Has
                    the effect of turning off the messages concerning weather
                    that pop up from time to time.
  Peaceful      16  No attacking or doing anything considered offensive here.
                    Should be NO_HEAL also.
  NO_STEAL      32  obvious.  No longer of practical worth though.
  NO_SUM        64  can't summon mobs or pcs out of these rooms
  NO_MAGIC     128  No spell casting of any sort.  NOTE: A mob "casts" spells
                    by calling a special procedure; such a room does NOT
                    prevent a mob from spell-casting.
  TUNNEL       256  /* flag should be set automatically by EDIT TUNNEL */
                    /* if room is a tunnel, be sure this is set */
  PRIVATE      512  It is impossible to astral/portal/goto to this room if it
                    already contains two characters.
                    Also the 'teleport' spell will never teleport a
                    player into this room.
  SILENCE     1024  You cannot hear sound or make sound.  PC's can't spell cast.
  NO_ORDER    2048  You cannot order mobs in these rooms.
  ANARCHY     4096  This flag allows players to attack one another
  HAVE_TO_WALK 8192  Just what is says. No astral or portal.
  ARENA       16384  Arena so players can kill each other and not lose hp
  NO_HEAL     32678  No regeneration of hits or mana occurs here.
  undefined   65536  doubles regen rate for owner (a PC) of house.
