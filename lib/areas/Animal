Entrance to Dark-Keep~
Through your many adventures you have never seen such an Evil Demonic place
such as this castle that stands before you.  You notice that it has no
visible openings besides a large Marble Black Door with a pale tooth as
a handle.  Through closer examination of the door, you notice some 
dimly glowing white "RUNES" etched into the door.

Main Gate House~
Pushing the massive door open, you feel a cold-dark chill rush through your
body as if something has been awakened by your presence in the castle.
As you look around, you notice that your armor and weapons look tarnished
as if something is eating away at them.  Farther down the hall, a pair of
red eyes watch you as you enter the castle.

Glowing Intersection!~
As you wander through the castle, you begin to ponder on what could have
possibly persuaded you to risk your life and enter this castle.
The sound of something moving interrupts your train of thought and before
you realize it, some very large half dragon-half human creatures move towards
you as they prepare to send you to your grave.

This room contains many racks for weapons and armor but you notice that
they are all empty and the thought of where all these weapons went
doesn't seem to brighten your spirits any.  Moving on towards the beds,
your search is interupted by a voice above you yelling "INTRUDERS!!"
Whipping around to prepare for battle, you see dropping from the top of
the ceiling what seem to be large spiders coming to attack you!

More and more, you wonder what lurks in this castle.  You feel the heat coming
off of the walls around you.  They glow with an orange-red aura and smell
of brimstone.  Something is cooking and it smells like its burning.  
Cooridors are all around you from all directions.

Burrrr!  What a weather change!  Walking into this tunnel, you see frost

a shivering sight.  A human fighter frozen in ICE with his shield avail
and sword swinging.  You wonder what he was fighting that would cause such a
deadly display.

other types of fungus grow in profusion. Green lichens, clinging to the walls,
shed a phosphorescent light, softly illuminating the vast chamber.
You feel wind coming from the east..and heat from the west..

large battle happened here a long time ago.  Hmmm, that's strange that
black pile is starting to move when you entered the room.  Maybe you

As you enter this massive entrance, you feel a waft of hot air overcome

laying about the room.  Looking upward, you notice a nice warm friendly 
Aged Red Dragon (well, maybe not friendly).  Looking down at you, he says 
with a large voice "Care for some roast marshmellows?"  This dragon is not like
other dragons you have seen before.  You should take precaution before you 
attack her!

ICE and fire wafting from the center.  Strange enough, the altar is not
melting. But what really gives you an urge to draw your blade for battle
is the slender and beautiful woman sitting in this wonderous chair.  She
seems to be creating a spell in the altar and has no attention for you.
By her side stands her personal guard ready to chop you in half.

Finally, you reach the bottom to find a boarded up entrance that looks like
a large building but most of the dirt and rock has covered the entrance to
it.  Just as you get ready to huff your way up the stairs, you feel a
small wind from the north.  You notice that an opening has been
blackened by Mother Nature.  Moving away the bricks, you find an entrance
and also discover a small beaten up SIGN plated into the wall.

Hmmm.. Looking by the condition of this room, it seems that the desk clerk

have been recently cleaned, as if a caretaker was tending to his graves.
Looking around, you see three archways leading north, east, and west.  All
of them clean and spotless.  Each of them have a white aura glowing around the
entrance.

The Smell of Fire and Brimstone is in the air . Planes of fire errupt in
large spouts of flaming lava. Fire Elementals Stand by him side by side 
as you see a ornerate man stiing at a stone table cover with pieces of
paper with little numbers on them in the corner you see a lighted sign
that says "now serving 666" .. He lifts his head and Says "Next!!".....
