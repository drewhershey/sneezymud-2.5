End of Astral Path~
    As you continue along the path, you run into  a thick
patch of crimson fog.  You feel such fear that you can no
longer continue along this unatural path.

The Grand Doorway~
     You stand at the foot of two HUGE silver doors.  They
appear to be the only entrance to a extremelly large astral
citadel of some type.  You remember a tale sung by a bard at
the Green Dragon in one day.  You vaguely remember the song,
but you remember it was about a race called the Githyanki,
and the mighty Gith and the Queen lich.  You wish you could
remember more, but your memory fails you.
You realize that you have discovered a Githyanki Ethreal
Citadel.

Center of Citadel Courtyard~
     Here in the center of the courtyard, you can see most of what
comprises the Githyanki Ethereal castle.  Despite the screaming 
guards and Githyanki that want you dead, You think this could be a 
nice place to live.

     You strut on into the Northern courtyard.  Not much different.
The only real change, is to the north you see an entrance into the 
large metallic tower which can be seen for a distance you know not
how to measure, since you are not in your realm, for you are in mine
now.

Northeast Courtyard~
      You arrive at the Northeast corner of the grassy courtyard.
This corner differs little from the other corners of the courtyard,
and come to think of it, could probably pass for those other corners
if some Geomancer came around and decided to do it. Hrm.

Not much different that the other parts of the courtyard, save that fact
that you can hear horse noises to the north.  Perhaps a stable or 
blacksmith is there.  To the west you see a grand hall, with a large
entrance arch with a intricately carved crest of arms.

Slash's Trophy Room~
    You are in Slash's trophy room, where he keeps all of
trophies of conquests of days when he was mortal.
On the blade of the Ebony Kris is the head of the Grand Master
of Magic, a look of surprise on her beutiful face.
In the corner is the skeletal Demi-Lich, its red pin-points of
light extinguished forever by slash.
Ina large plexie glass box is the head of the mighty Kalas, with
many gnashes and scares in the bone.
Both Ruggy and Queeklor are here, posed in battle positions, but
no longer living, their stares blank.
