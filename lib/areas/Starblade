On a Sandy Beach~
     You are washed ashore a beach with most the grotesque litter you
have ever seen. All around you are bleached bones and skulls and they
are not of animals either! To the east and west are is more beach and
to the distant north you make out a large complex.

Sand Dunes~
     Strecthing out before you is more sand, sand, sand. The complex
you saw earlier seems closer and hope it is because the bilstering
sun rains down on you with a fury unto itself. You need to find succor
from the fatal heat which saps at your strength.

On a Sandy Beach~
     Strecthing out before you is miles and miles of sand. Littering the
the beach are the remains of animals, both of beasts and of men. In the
distant north-west you see a large complex. To the east, west, and north is
more sand and surf. To the south is the turbulent Dragon Sea. You debate
whether you would have a better chance of survial in the sea rather
than this Gods-forsaken island.

Sand Dunes~
     More sand beckons you to the north and the west. To the east and south
the are the outer edges of the island. You wished you had brought your
suntan lotion, the ozone layer seems to be particularly thin here. As the
sand fills your shoes you wonder if you have a little annex to Hell.

sand-club. To the west are sand dunes and further north cliffs can be seen.
To the south is another corner of beach. Darn, the sun must be

out some sort of Stand to the north. You hear the pounding of the surf upon
the sand in all directions.

or is that the smell that emanates from this area? Upwards leads to some
relief from the unforgiving sun. To the north and the south stretches
more coastline. While to the east the interior of the island can be found,
although, it looks more like a giant kitty litter box to you.

Southwestern Seawall~
     At this corner of the obrate wall of colrless and seamlessness
you find that you can see the beginnings of a lush tropical forest.
The startling contrast between the desert of sand and the "ocean" of
trees is quite remarkable! The southern direction will lead you back
into the sands while west will lead you to the entrance to this complex.
The wall extends to the north and westerly movement is impossible. You also
notice an odd pool of water by your feet. It might be possible to enter
it.

Gates of Obsidian~
     You stand before the massive gates of this complex. The gates are
crafted the the blackest obsidian. The very sunlight is sucked between
these gates. Runic symbols of the finest silver adorn the gates. These
"wards" were meant either to keep you out or to keep something or someone
in. Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, or something even more mysertious awaits beyond
these gates. To the west and east the wall continues. South will lead you
back into the sands.

     A colourless and seamless wall impedes northernly movement. You wonder,
as you stare at the wall, what manner of being could have crafted such a 
structure. You have mixed feelings of intrigue and foreboding to what inhabits
the otherworld edifice. The wall extends to the west and the east. To the
south, the sands beckon you.

Southeastern Seawall~
     You have reached the corner wall of a huge complex. The wall itself is
most unusual. The two thing things you find wierd about the wall, its
seamlessness and its utter lack of colour. The wall is neither white nor
transparent it simply lacks any colour at all! The wall extends deep into
the rocks and appears to delve into the Dragon Sea. The "Wall" extends to
the east and the north. To the south you see more of this island's
meandering coastline. The pounding waves inhibits any easternly movement.

No poet in the world or muds could describe the beauty of the a ewind b

You may go down, back to this hell-bent island or go westward across the

Lost in the Swamp~
     As you tread your way through the Swamp, the feeling that someone is
watching still persists. Although, the only thing you can see through the
bog mists is glowing phoserences and swampy flora. All directions will
lead you deeper into the swamp.

ergonomic chairs with its back to you. Wailing from the chair is a smallish
nerd. The nerd incessantly screams about a "password"? In his hand his a
slide ruler. Although it doesn't seem to be too dangerous, it glows with
an eldritch green sheen. The 4 foot blunder hops off his chair and whirls
around to meet you face to kneecap. In a high squeeky voice the hacker
says, ' I want the PASSWORD!' With the dextretity that only a Computer
Hacker could attain he springs into your face.................

A very nasty creature of the dimbulb species.

Cellblock I Hallway~
     As you move cautiously through the hallway, you try to shrug of
the sense of impending doom which almost eclipses all hope of escaping
this madhouse. There is another cell door to the west and the end of the
hallway to the north.

Capt'n Hook's Cell~
     You always wondered what happened to Capt'n Hook after he was 
deafeated by Peter Pan. It seems that he was sentenced to this hell hole
to serve some time. This is not a very happy camper! The room is in a
total disarray. The bedding is shredded better than any Politican's 
mechanical shredder. It would appear that Capt'n Hook would like to try his
namesake on you!

Jack the Ripper's Cell~
     You enter a room which is done totally in white. The walls are 
streaked with amazely accurate sketches of human anatomy. In the far
corner you see a figure dressed in green and has a white surgical mask
of his head. Although, you aren't into medical fashion you can only be
impressed by the long sharp scalpel which the "Doctor" has clenched
in his gloved covered hand. As you start to back out of the cell, the
figure speaks, "Welcome to Operating Theater"!

There is a very high proability that you are the intended guest for
tonite's show. Having your heart removed as the show will be great
for the ratings!
