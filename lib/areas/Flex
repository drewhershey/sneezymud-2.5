Flex's Flexing Room
~
You can see that the bookshelves that line the walls are filled with books on 
bodybuilding and weightlifting...  They also contain every suplement known 
to man and a few that are not.  In the corner the Flexilator rests... it is
pulsing with power and seems ready to go...

Joy and Paine's Wax Museum~
     As you enter the foyer to Joy and Paine's Wax Museum, you are struck
by the deep red wall-to-wall carpeting.  In addition, the deep red wall-paper
gives the room a dim, almost black, atmosphere.  To the left a small wooden
desk rests with a little old lady sitting at it.  To the north another
room may be seen.
