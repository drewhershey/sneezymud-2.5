At the edge of a vast forest~
You stand at the edge of a vast forest which stretches to the
east. To the west lies a decaying road.  Apparently this road
once continued eastward into the dark woods, but neglect has
allowed the forest to create an impassable barrier.  A small
tunnel, however, has recently been cut through a colossal tree,
thus providing passage.

In a hilly field~
You stand on a hill among rows of strange bushes and plants.  A short
fence to the west has aparently been broken through by force.  Near
the breech in the fence, the bushes and plants have been cut down and
trampled. The fields extend to the south and to the north.  To the
west is the back of a small, round farmhouse.

Outside the gates of a gnome village~
The unmistakable architecture of the gnomes makes the tiny city to the
south incredibly beautiful to behold.  Nestled in a valley, the village's
solid colors sharply contrast the multi-hued chaos of the exotic plants
dotting the surrounding country-side.  To the north a gravel road ascends
out of the valley.  To the south lie the gates of the village.
The gates seem to be closed while the village is under construction.
