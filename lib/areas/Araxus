Castle Throne Room~
As you enter the room you notice several symbols and markings
of unholy nature.  The room is light enough to see, but rather dim.
A huge pentacle is laid out upon the floor, the dweomer of some evil
magic is in the air.  At the far back of the room, you see a brilliant
throne of crystal, strange runes of gold are set into the throne.  Your
heart stops for a moment as you notice the decayed, skeletal form of a
lich seated in the throne, the red glow of its eyes fixed dead upon you.
With a quick motion of its hand, the door from which you entered
magically forms into a stone wall.  The only exit is an ornate door
set into the wall behind the throne of the lich!  An evil laugh echoes
through the air.
The Demi-Lich leaps from his throne as you enter the room, his evil
eyes fixed dead upon you!
.....The Demi-Lich glows with a bright light!
