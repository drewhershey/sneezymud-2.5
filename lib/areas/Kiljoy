A Long Walkway~
     You have left the forest paths to step on a concrete walkway, bordered by
patches of odd red moss.  It heads north toward a glittering object seen
far ahead.  You want to turn back, but the shining get more and more luring,
you have no choice but to continue on.

It seems to be a giant prism, taking in white light then refracting it to a 
rainbow of color.  Is this what would happen to you if you got near it? Do you 
adventure foreward or leave back to town?

     You are inside the oddly shaped light bending machine.  The sides are all

out as soon as you land. When you come to, you see you're sitting on a prism
glass pile shattered everywhere.  You try to walk, but discover that is a bit
tricky since you seem to be weightless.  After you regain you balance you look 
ahead into the distance and see nothing but a black space and grey landscape.
Odd, but the moon looks a whole lot bigger, and bluer...WOW! The sun looks big.
You soon come to the realization that you have left earth and landed on the 
moon.  You sit down in your dismay and happen to take notice to some runes

small trickle.  Every now and again a large flush comes down and rushes you
away.  Everything here is mostly dark, but you can tell where you are in.
It is a large area, made out of moon metal that emenates it's own light.

Sewer Pipe~

of moonrocks and waste laying all over here.  The water continues ahead of you,

of the echo through the pipes.  You are able to make out some movement ahead of

is smoke filled and so are the ashtrays with "Moonbeam" cigarettes.  Music seems
to come from nowhere, playing the theme from "Cheers"  This place seems to be
