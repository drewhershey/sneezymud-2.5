   You are floating in a formless void, detached from all sensation of physical
matter, surrounded by swirling glowing light, which fades into the relative
darkness around you without any trace of edges or shadow.

mural painting~
  A horde of mighty Viking warriors is charging from a Longboat straight
towards you, raising their swords and axes to split your skull.  In the boat,
you see a figure clothed in simple white robes, praying.  He seems to be 
illuminated by a soft white light.  Dark clouds cover the sky, and corpses
litter the ground behind the warriors.  You get an uneasy feeling when looking
at this mural.
~
E
horde~
   The horde of Viking warriors wear armor of leather and chain.  Blood drips
from their clothing as they work to ensure their place in the grand hall of
Valhalla.

'X'
~
E
figure priest~
   The Viking priest has a smirk on his face as he prays.  He appears to
approve of this bloodshed, or at least know something that you don't.  He
is dressed in fine white robes, and he has several magical devices about him,
a ring, a holy symbol, a necklace and a wide belt.
~
E
robes~
   The white robes of the Viking priest shimmer softly.  Near the bottom, the
shadows make the robes dull grey in color.
~
E
ring~
   The ring is made of gold and jade.  It looks like it contains much power.
~
E

   The belt is made of black leather, with a silver buckle.  On the buckle is
a pair of blood red spears crossed to make an 'X'

	Welcome to the hall of rules.  "Rules" start at 667, and go through

However, they will be rewritten.

671-675 is a list of godly duties.  If you want to move up in levels, I
recommend that you read it.  

More will be added as thought of.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
The mostly dont's of being immortal:

(1) On playing a mortal character:
    - ABSOLUTELY NO HELP WHAT-SO-EVER FOR ONE OF YOUR OWN MORTALS!
      The point being you have already achieved the goal of the game.
      By helping yourself in this way, you detract from others chances.
    - Don't pass on equipment, especially not to one of your own.
    - Don't give your 'old' characters to other people or I will treat
      them as if it is you. And DON'T let them play your immortal!
    - No playing both immortal/mortal types at the same time, there should
      be no legitimate need for this.
    - Similarly switching back and forth between mortal/immortal looks
      as though you are obtaining information to help you and you probably
      are, so don't.

(2) Assisting other players:
    - Advising a new player how to start is expected behavior, but
      advising him/her what his stats are or stats on an item is not.
      DO NOT inform people of object/monster stats!
    - DO NOT cast spells for mortals, and don't use spells against them
      ie casting Sanctuary on mobs.
    - Don't trans them around to avoid encounters or to put them in harms way.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
(3) On Dealing with problem players:
    Don't just up and kill them. Don't use info you receive as immortal
    to come on and hunt-down/summon players for the purpose of killing.
    (This is not to say you couldn't advise someone who they were killed
     by. Just make sure it stays their affair and not yours.)
    Do try to talk to them and inform them where they are going wrong.
    Be polite, but if they are not polite in return there is no reason to
    listen to them. If they refuse to listen, either inform a higher level
    or get a couple other immortal witnesses. Then move them out of harms
    way and if need be strip them of equipment.

You invested time and effort in making immortal, but it is a privilage and
comes with a responsibility to act responsibly. Violators will be delt with.
I not exclude the possibility of deletion, demotion or banning immortals.
You should read the wizard board each visit to stay informed of any changes
to policy.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
 If you wish to continue to play as a mortal there a few things I
would like you to keep in mind:

1) Don't be an item hog. You should not be keeping equipment for
   more than ONE player. If you play more than one character that
   is fine, but I would hope you wouldn't play more than one at
   a time.

2) The items you keep should be minimal. No reason why you should
   have 2 energy bows, a katana and a claw. You can't use them all
   at once so why have them. Same for armour and other items. If
   you can't use them at the same time you probably have too much.
   Items you get rid of should NOT be sold but put on the dump so
   they circulate back to the game and other people have the chance
   to experience getting them.

3) Avoid the urge to curry favor amoung people by 'starting' out
   newbies with a generous helping of experience points and or
   items. Give a modest amount of gold if you like or take them
   on a mini-tour of areas they can handle. They will have more
   fun if they can experience things for themselves. Anyone you
   group with should be of approximately the same level.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
If you are noted violating these conditions your items may be removed
or if a repeat offender demotion or erasure or mortals may be called for.
I don't wish to restrict your playing entirely - I'm glad you enjoy what
I have created enough to go back for more. But you must keep in mind that
there are other people playing and they deserve to have the same opportunities
and struggles you hopefully went through.
 If there is anyone that can't live up to these responsibilities, you should
consider finding another mud to pass your time on.

Lowest level god. This level is ideal for becoming acquainted with godhood. 
It is the reward for successfully running up through ranks of mortality.
As an Immortal, you are to enhance the play of the game, by switching into 
mobiles and giving them "personalities", etc. However, do NOT- directly or
indirectly- interfere with the play/actions of mortals. You have left mortality
behind you; therefore, do not seek to continue aiding your mortal running mates
via stat or other priviledged information.
To advance from this level simply behave and show an interest in
adding to the mud.

   You stand upon a grassy field.  A bull stands grazing not far away and
out of the corner of your eye you can see him considering you.  The sound
of animals fill the air from the north.  To the south you see a pig pen.

Gamgee Residence~
   You stand inside a modest home.  You deduce that this is indeed the home
of whomever owns the surrounding lands.  The air is somewhat musty and 
the smell reminds you of a stable.  As you look around disdainfully, you
think to yourself that this is more of a shack than a proper residence and
you long for the urban riches of the Shire proper.

   Animals of every sort fill the small barn.  You feel the hot breath of
horses and cows on your neck and you feel the sudden need for fresh air.
Other than that, you feel cozy and protected and don't mind staying for a
bit longer.  All the warmth and good vibes remind you of the days when your
mother would hold you in her arms and sing you to sleep.  You find yourself
wanting to cradle all the animals.

The Green Dragon~
   Welcome to the Green Dragon, the undisputed leader in the art of
innkeeping.  A rather charming and friendly hostess stands to the side,
ready to offer you food and drink.  While most of the patrons are halfling
locals, you spy an occasional human or two.  As you listen more closely
to the conversations that fill the inn, you hear the tales of great and
seasoned adventurers as well as the usual gossip.  You feel as if you've
found your second home in the Green Dragon.  You see a stairway leading

Exxon's Retreat~
     As you step through the mirror you feel a tingling sensation run
through your body.  Much to your surprise you are standing on dusty
clifftop overlooking a magnificient ocean.  The sun seems to be frozen
just over the horizon, turning the ocean into a swirling plain of gold
and black reflections.  A warm and gentle breeze brushes your face.
You hear the roar of the waves crashing rhythmically on the rocks below,
interspersed with cries of seagulls floating lazily overhead.
     To the north you can see a large city by the oceanside, far larger
than Midgaard, perhaps far larger than any city you've seen before.  It
seems to extend infinitely to the north.  From this distance the city
resembles a spectacular field of colorful lights, twinkling before you
in silent majesty.

attacks~
The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per
round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the
probability of getting an extra attack each round. (ie. if you were VERY
lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)
 
[a few samples: Level--#Att]
 1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25   25--2.50

               BOLD ADVENTURERS!!
 
   Recently, it seems that some nasty little monsters made a hole in our wall
dowstairs in the Cellar. We soundly trashed them and none of them have enough
courage to enter the Cellar again, however, the Monastary would appreciate it
if you would help us keep their numbers down and fear in their hearts.
   Though the Monastary could easily purge the menace, we just don't feel like
taking the time away from our prayers and training to do this. Any assistance
you provide would be appreciated and you may keep anything you find down
there as a reward for your help.

Hall of Rules~
   Welcome to the hall of rules.  The rooms above and below this one contain a
list of the laws of the land for Motel VI.  You are expected to know the rules
and to abide by them.  Failure to do so is punishable by any of the immortals in
whatever manner they see fit.  If you are found in violation of any of the
laws, and are punished, you may appeal the ruling to a god of higher level
then the one punishing you with the decision of Brutius being final.
 
In all cases, it is the spirit and not the letter of the law that should be
obeyed.  The spirit of the law is designed to maximize enjoyment for all
players and not to favor anyone over someone else.
 
Lastly, this hall of rules is not comprehensive.  Laws are created, eliminated
and changed from time to time.  Typing NEWS should keep you apprised of such
alterations.

Hall of Rules~
Player Killing and Stealing..
..is strictly forbidden EXCEPT in one of the designated anarchy zones.  It
should be impossible to PK/PS anywhere outside of the anarchy zones and you
cannot be summoned into one of the anarchy zones.  Within the anarchy zones,
PK/PS rules are non-existant.  No god will reimburse you for a PK/PS within
such a zone; YOU assume responsiblity for your own life and belongings when
you enter the anarchy zone.  If a PC constantly PK/PS's players of lower levels
he will be punished.  This is the only unacceptible form of PK/PS in such
 a zone.
   For an up to date list of the anarchy zones, ask a god or a fellow player.

Corpse Looting and kill stealing..
..is considered in bad taste but is NOT illegal.  However, if SCUM loots the
corpse that VICTIM just killed or jumps in at the last minute and tries to
steal the kill, VICTIM can seek revenge.  So long as such revenge is 
consistant with the other laws here, no divine intervention will occur.
  Please note that if a corpse dries up and blows away, any stuff that was in
it is considered fair game.  This also applies to your own corpse should you
get killed.  If you fail to recover what was in your corpse before it dries up,
anyone is permitted to get the stuff that was lying there free for the taking
if they desire.  (exception: anything personalized as yours by a god is
excluded.)  Any item found just lying there is a gift to the first to find it.

...are permissible with the following restrictions.  No single player may ever
have more then three (3) of his characters on simultaneously.  This number
drops to two (2) if the total number of players exceeds 30.
    "Robots" that add nothing to the game are considered illegal.  This means
that if you write a script that has a robot heal people if asked you are OK
(and probably beloved by your fellow PC's).  BUT, if the script merely has
your robot sit in a room doing the same thing over and over again for personal
gain (e.g.  creating a scroll of recall, sleeping for mana, then creating more
recalls as mana regenerates; or, writing a script to have you fight a given
mob every time it regenerates) then you are considered in violation.

Instruction Room for Jail~
      This is the room where you figure out how to use the Jails.
The time a person must spend in jail is as follows:
You must be of an editing level to set the duration of the room.
This is done by editing the teleport function of the room.
The formula is as follows.

edit tele <time> 3001 1
time is set as follows:
300 = 1 tick
the duration of the sentence doubles with the offense.
It starts at 4 ticks. Such that first offense is 4 ticks,
second eight, third sixteen, etc.
For a 3 offense the time would be: 16 * 300 = 4800

The fine a person gets is as follows:
        10% of gold carried and or in bank, depending on which
        you can tell.
        Take the best weapon the person has away from them.

        And you fine them a number of items equal to one less than
        the offense.
Example:
If this is a person's fourth offense they get fined as follows:
40% of their gold is taken (round up)
The person's best weapon is taken
The person looses their 3 best items.

New Adventurer's Lounge~
  You have entered a palacial lounge whose sole purpose seems to be
to allow you to relax and to inform the newly arrived adventurers
with some knowledge.  To that end, many beautiful maidens wait
off in the wings, ready to massage fatigued muscles.  A richly
dressed youth comes up to you and offers you fine delicacies on a
silver platter.  He bows slightly as he does so and you feel
bemused as he refers to you as Sahib.  A plush couch is off to
one side with a reading table next to it. ...Hanging above the
couch is a poster displaying a Map of Midgaard. The reading table
contains:
...A NOTE to new players.
...A HANDOUT about you!
...The GUIDE to monsters and fighting.
...A TREATISE on levelling, practices and skills.
...Some helpful HINTS for the adventurer.
...and a LEAFLET on dying.

leaflet2~
Ultimately however, all but the most conservative or lucky of adventurer's
finds himself to be compromised by a monster.  A character with 0 hp's
is stunned but will slowly heal if left alone.  A player with -1 to -10
hp's is considered to be unconscious and dying.  If another player does
not come to his aid quickly, he will slowly die.  If the character goes
below -10 hp's, he is dead, and only the greatest of magics can alter that,
and even that has consequences...  Most mosters will not stop fighting you
until either you or they are dead.  Choose your battles carefully.
 
Death, however, is not "permanent".  You may reenter the game at the
Temple of Midgaard.  You will have 1 hp and be missing all of your
equipment and gold.  Your equipment and gold is within your corpse which
you left behind at the scene of the battle.  You should go and fetch your
belongings (remember to SAVE once it is in your possession).  Monsters
that were angry at you will have forgotten you if you died (Aggressives
are still aggro, however).  Too, you will find that your xp has been 
decreased by half up to a maximum of 2 million xp.
 
Death is of course an annoyance and not something to be sought.  It is
possible to recover from it.  
 
Also, and most importantly, this is after all, only a game.   :)
~
E
leaflet1~
The simplest and easiest way to avoid dying is to never involve yourself
in a fight.  This is not a long-term practical solution if you also 
expect to level.  At some point, fighting becomes necessary.
 
If the battle goes sour, FLEE'ing is always an option provided you are
able to (conscious, standing) and that an exit exists from the melee.
Having WIMPY set to true will cause you to flee at some fixed percentage
of your max hp's so you need not worry about it too much.  FLEE'ing is
an ignoble retreat from the field of battle and, as such, is penalized
by causing some xp loss dependant on your level.
 
If fleeing is not an option or you choose not to, you may also RECITE
RECALL and magically relocate yourself out of the fight.  It is 
usually wise to rest and get another recall before returning to the
fight.
 
One should not overlook the proper use of certain spells as a means to
ward off death.  Ones of the healing variety and sanctuary decrease
your risk of death dramatically if properly used.  Many can be cast in
battle and it is a good spell caster who knows how and when to use his
spells.  For the thaumatergically-handicapped, potions exist to help
you and can be QUAFF'd.  A battle is a rough climate and potions may
break if you try to imbibe them during the fray.
 
Lastly, only the most foolhardy fights unprepared.  Be as well equipped
as you can, engage whatever protective spells prior to the fight, and
check to be sure you're good condition physically and mentally before
the fray.  Rest/sleep when you need to regenerate some.
~
E
leaflet death avoid~
A two-part series.  leaflet1 details ways to avoid dying.  leaflet2 is
on death itself.
~
E
hints2~
SAVE whenever you have achieved something good or completed a 
monumental task.  Reimbursement is generally given (HELP REIMBURSE),
but in the event of a crash it is your duty to have saved prior to it.
At the end of your session, RENT at the receptionist.
 
If in trouble, be not afraid to ask for help.  Every player has at one
point found themselves in a tight spot and most will be willing to lend
a hand if they are able.  No one wants to do your work for you, but
most will lend assistance to keep you self-sufficient.  Be polite,
don't be pushy.  Remember what killed you, if such is the case, to aid
in corpse retrieval.  Return the favor if someone asks you for help at
a later date.
~
E
hints1~
Carry a scroll of recall at all times.  If the battle goes poorly, RECITE
RECALL and get yourself to a place where you can rest up and gather help
before returning to the fray.
 
Carry sufficient supplies for the adventure at hand.  Food and water is
a must as well as a container to hold a large enough supply for 
extended journeys.  For the more advanced, healing elixirs and potions
should be brought along and QUAFF'd when appropriate.
 
Literally in the dark?  Find a place that sells light sources (torches,
lanterns) and HOLD them when you need more illumination.  Realize that
such sources are limited and burn out.  Find a permanent light source
as soon as possible.
 
Can't get to where you want to be?  Some areas require either a boat,
gills or wings to journey in.  The more rugged areas take their toll
on your movement allowance.  Finding spells or items that eliminate
this problem is another important task.
 
Always look around for a group to join with.  Interaction with other
players is half the fun of playing.  It also simplifies killing many
monsters you might not be able to handle alone.
 
When you have defeated a monster, LOOK IN CORPSE/PILE to see what
booty you have won.  GET <item>/ALL CORPSE to loot it.  Killed more
then one creature?  GET ALL 2.corpse, 3.corpse...  should help you
get rich quick.
 
~
E
treatise leveling practices~
In time, you will have done battle and defeated enough monsters that your
experience will allow you to gain a new level.  SCORE will show you your
present xp as well as your present level.  LEVEL <class> details the
amount needed by each class to level.
 
When the time comes to advance to a higher level, go to your guildmaster
and GAIN.  (HELP GAIN)(HELP XP)  At this point you will advance to the
new level, gain hit points and mana as appropriate and you will be
granted more practice sessions and the skills available to your new 
level.  Also at your guildmaster, you should PRACTICE to see what
skills/spells are known to you.  HELP <skill> to choose what is worth
learning and PRACTICE <skill> once your mind is made up.  It may
require more than one session to fully learn a skill, but items exist
to increase your number of practices and to shorten the time it takes
to learn a skill...
 
Not everything can be learned from the guildmasters close to town.
You will most assuredly want to forage about and look for master's in
other, more remote areas.  For this is where you will learn the most
advanced skills and things not taught by anyone else...
~
E
handout you~
The easiest way to find out about yourself is to type SCORE.  This will
show you quite a bit of general information about yourself, including:
current and maximum hit points, mana and movement; alignment - that is
your inclination toward goodness/evilness; experience points gained and
levels achieved.
 
Eventually you can utilize the ATTRIBUTE command which shows you a lot
more detail.  Armor class, your specific stats (str, dex, int, wis, con),
to hit and to dam bonuses, spells affecting you and degree of hunger and
thirst.
 
For interesting trivia you might also cast a scroll of identify upon
yourself or another...

note new players~
Hail, and welcome to Motel VI, a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) using
diku-code.  In essence, you have just stepped into a role-playing game set
in a sword and sorcery environment.  Like you, there are other people
connected to the game who are adventuring, interacting and having fun.
Your task is: 1.) to equip yourself with food armament and items of
magic; 2.) explore Midgaard and its surrounds; 3.) locate monsters and
do battle with them thus earning fortune and fame; 4.) return to rearm
and reequip yourself and to report your feats of heroicism.
 
The other periodicals lying about here detail much of the information that
you eventually want to know.  For now, type HELP to see a list of most of
the commands available to you.  HELP <command> to get particular info
about a specific command.  HELP <class> to get help on the different 
classes (be sure to do this on the one(s) you've chosen).  PRACTICE
<class> to see a list of the skills available to you. SCORE to learn a
little about your person.  INVENTORY and EQUIPMENT to see what you have.
WIMPY so that you will flee rather then fight to the death if the battle
goes poorly for you.  Read the NEWS as it details many changes not 
detailed herein.
 
Be sure to SAVE often and RENT at the reception when you are done.

Motel VI is a diku-based multi-user dungeon (MUD).  All of which means
that many real people are logged in (just like you) and are interacting
in a sword and sorcery role playing environment.  Please realize that this
is a game and, therefore, entertainment and the people you deal with are
real life so that some rules of conduct apply so that entertainment is
possible for all parties.
 
Your "goal" is: first and foremost to have fun.  This is gone about
by interacting with the other people and creatures of the realm of 
Midgaard.  A secondary goal is to gain power and wealth by fighting
the monsters that threaten Midgaard.  
 
Two things should be remebered at all times: 1.) This is only a game.
and 2.) You are a human being and are expected to act like one.

helpful hints~

~
E
treatise levelling skills~
With perserverance, you will eventually accumulate enough experience to
become a higher level.  It would be a good idea to read the help files
on XP, GAIN and PRACTICE.  
 
You may find out how much experience you need to level by typing
LEVEL <class>.  Experience is gained by fighting and killing monsters.
It can be lossed by dying or by fleeing from a monster.  At present,
you will lose 1/2 of your xp if you die, up to a maximum of 2 million
xp.  Amount lost due to fleeing is based on your level.
 
Note that you MUST go to your guildmaster and GAIN to actually raise a
level, it will not occur until you do so.  Also some skills can be learned
before they can actually be used.  You should make sure to do HELP <skill>
and see if you can use it at your level before you PRACTICE it.
~
E
guide monster fighting~
In your travels you will most certainly run across a monster you have
never encountered before.  At times like this, it is a wise decision to
CONSIDER <monster>.  This will give you an evaluation of the level 
difference between yourself and the mobs, and hence, a rough idea
of how difficult it would be for you to kill it.  Quite clearly,
it would be unwise to attack something that is listed as: what do you
want your epitaph to read?  whereas, a monster that is Absolutely,
positively to easy for you is probably a waste of time.
 
Realize however: Con only shows you the level difference between you
and the monster.  It does not take into account either your or the
monster's special abilities and skills (breath weapon, spell casting
ability and the like).  Let the adventurer beware...
 
Also note: grouping is always a possibility for taking out those
mobs that want to find out what to put on your tombstone...  CON
does NOT take into account how powerful your group is, just how
good your chances are alone.
 
And as a final warning: Some CON's are far from true.

you see the open doors of the apothecary shop where one may buy many
magical livations.

made of brick and it has a rusting metal roof with a few chimneys
sticking out.  The vegetation seems a bit unkempt for a house in the
noble district, but the residents obviously are above catering to the
needs of their neighbors.
  Diamond Street is south of here.  The wooden front door to the north

East porch of the DanjerHaus~
  This is a very comfortable place to relax on a warm summer day.  The
porch is made mostly of brick with a ceiling fan in the middle of wood
roof.  The porch is screened beginning about 2' off the floor and
ending at the ceiling.  You can see Diamond Street south through the
screens.
 There are a few couches along the walls and some chairs facing the
couches.  Maybe you should have a nap?
  Through the glass paned door to the west is the living room.
Through a screen door to the north is an overgrown, narrow side yard.

  This room is EXTREMELY messy.  There is laundry piled in a number of
corners and spilling out of the closet.  Every horizontal surface,
including the floor, is covered by something.  Books, printouts, and
clothes are scattered around the room haphazardly.
  There is a messy bed in the middle of the room and a couch and chair
for visitors, although they would have to remove a few layers of junk
to sit down.  There is a rather small stereo system in the closet with
a small collection of CDs.

  You are in the garage of the DanjerHaus.  What a dangerous place it
is too.  There are tools scattered all over the place and a mostly
disassembled VW van on the west half of the concrete slab.  The
ceiling over the concrete slab is aluminum, supported by poles.  The
garage proper is closed and contains lots of furniture and probably
poisonous spiders.  The house is to the east and a wooden fence blocks
any movement west.
  A wide path leads north to the back yard.  There is a lane between
parked cars south of here that leads to the front yard.  To the east
is a brick porch with garbage cans and laundry appliances.

Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty. Above stands the reminants of one of the watchtowers. Archways

A ledge by the dark pool~
You can't see much here but the echo tells you that there's quite a drop
down. You can just make out a huge dark pool out there in the darkness, 
mostly because of the trickling of water. The water from the sewer actually
washes over this ledge and makes it quite slippery. From here it drops, 
like a waterfall, into the pool far down.

Down the old well~
You are dangling on the slippery sides of the old well leading down and up.
The only secure point here is the metal bars that are cemented into the

shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from

Natural Cavern~
This area of the dungeon appears to be somewhat natural. There are no signs of
stonework on any of the cavern walls. A dim light, coming from some strange
type of mold, lights this area with a dim green light. Small creatures scurry 
away from your approaching lights, seeking safety in the shadows of the many
bolders and stalagmites that fill this cavern. A small opening lies to the 
east.

Chamber of the Keeper~
This is the room of the Foreman of the Hill Giant Construction crews. He 
appears to be in charge of the building of the dungeons located under the 
compound. A desk stand over to one side, stacks of papers piled high upon it.
A bunk sits in one corner and there are many skins covering the floor against 
the inherent dampness associated with caves.

You stand on a well maintained road leading east towards New Thalos
and west towards the Eastern Mountains. To the north you can see
wide plains stretching out as far as the eye can see. South of you
begins a dark green forest.

the Sea of Dragons. To the south of you lies the great eastern desert
and north a wide open expanse of grass. You can just barely make out
a road that seems to be traveling along side the river but the
banks are to steep for you to see very far.

On a road~
The people of New Thalos take great pride in the services their
city may provide. One of these services is the construction crews
the go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher then other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.

You walk along a well used road with beautiful scenery. To the north
tall pine trees form a wall that goes on for miles. Between the road
and the trees lies a great expanse of grassy plains. South of here, 
beyond the river, lies the Great Eastern Desert. The road continues

Ascent to Graecia~
The silvery cord that you are ascending extends beyond the realm
of consciousness.   You can see the cord extending into another realm,
that seems much different from the world of Midgaard.  You take a short
break from climbing and catch a glimpse of the world around you.  The
cord in which you began to climb extends downward to a tiny globe.  Wait
a minute...that globe looks familiar...its Midgaard!  All around you are
the stars and pitch black sky.  You can identify the major
constellations, and you only hope that the silvery cord in which you
climbed leads to a familiar place.  A shadowy shape slowly fades into
existance from the starry background.  You think it would be a good
idea to continue onward.

Entrance to Graecia~
You have arrived in a strange place indeed.  You are standing on the
crest of of a huge hill.  The meadow at your feet is peaceful and calm,
unlike the savage world that you are accustomed.  The meadow extends
northward to a paved road which extends beyond the range of your vision.
The view from this hill is awesome.  You have an excellent aerial view
of this strange place.  To the northeast is gigantic mountain, extending
above the clouds, that towers above the lands below.  To the northwest is
vast ocean stretching out of sight.  You can also make out a city at
the end of the great paved road to the north.  There is also an old
wooden sign which seems to mystically entice you to read it.

The Great Brick Road~
It is strange indeed to travel on such a straight and smoothly paved
road.  You notice several deeply worn grooves that seem to run parallel
to the direction of the road.  These ruts almost seem to be part of the
road design, but you know better.  To the north the road extends northward to
the great city on the horizon.  To your east you see the beginning of a
great forest that makes Mirkwood seem feeble in comparison.

The forest to the east seems even more ominous.  You get the feeling
that someone is monitoring your progress.  To the west is a large
building.  As you peer at the building the architecture seems quite foreign
to you.  There are large columns with bas reliefs of great battles supporting
the roof.  You hear the sound of laughter and cheering from inside the
building.  There is also a large insignia of the arched entrance of a
huge sword.  You are overwhelmed by the feeling of safety which issues
forth from the building.

the hole which serves as a basin for the rainwater.  Inside the building
are several armored men and women talking to each other, they all stare
at you as you enter, then quickly return to the business.  Along the
walls of this building are larger pictures of fabled monsters and
fearless men fighting to the death.  You also can make out a smaller
exit to the north that seems hidden.  To the north you can hear the
the sounds of water splashing against great rocks.

You have arrived at the eastern edge of the Great Ocean.  There are huge
boulders scattered along the rocky coast.  As the ocean collides with
boulders you feel uneasy.  It reminds you that the strange lands in which
you have entered are filled with great mystery.  Looking out to sea you
can make out several rocky islands.  Only great legends speak of what
lies on those unexplored lands.  There are men here building sea faring
vessels, and you can see a large man directing them.  These ships are
unlike any you have seen before and they seem able to withstand the
mighty ocean unlike the rafts and canoes in which you are so familiar.

goes to the east and west.  To the west, the path leads to the vast
ocean and to the east the path twists into a mysterious forest.

army would consider an invasion upon this fabulous city.  Beyond the
city entrance is the Main Plaza, which serves as the center of activity
for Graecia.

instruments, and in a corner is a group engaged in a heated debate.
Chariots are passing through at a such rapid pace, you almost have to
actively dodge them.  To the north is the Palace and Grand Hall of the
ruler of Graecia.  To the east and west, paved roads extend throughout
the town.  As you look to the east you can see buildings built of
fine materials such as marble and obsidian, while to the west the
shadows make the road look a bit threatening.  A paved road also extends
to the south gate of town.

Grand Hall of Agamemnon~
Scholars and wise men make up the court of King Agamemnon.  You have
interupted a great debate.  As you enter the scholars recognize that you
are foreigners and hail your arrival.  King Agamemnon welcomes you to
the land of Graecia and bids you a safe journey.  He is seated on a
throne of pure gold embedded with so many jewels that the sunlight
reflected from them nearly blinds you.  You consider stealing some of
the jewels, but you realize that Agamemnon could smite you if you
angered him.  At his side, Clytemnestra, his wife, smiles
with a glint of betrayal in her eyes.  After greeting you the court
ignores you and returns to their discussion.  There are also large
columns here providing tall deep shadows and occasionally you can see a
figure dart in between them.  You realize that even the brave Agamemnon
is not without enemies and this land of Graecia is not as peaceful as it
seems.

The paved road that you have been accustomed now takes on a different
look.  The bricks are no longer neatly laid in place, and the buildings
that you pass are progressively in worse condition.  Occassionally you
see a shadowy figure in the corner of your eyes.  Whenever you try to
catch a glimpse of the figure, it disappears into the shadows.  Your
progress to the west is blocked by a wooden wall.  You wonder why a
wooden wall is in the middle of the street, then you see some movement
behind the wall.  An arrow stikes the ground at your feet, and you
realize that that was only a warning shot.  Obviously, it would be a
good idea to leave this area quickly.

fortresses with flowing fountains and beautiful gardens latently behind
the walls of these buildings.  You would think that there would be a
crime problem in this area, but the multitude of guards in the area
suggests otherwise.  To the east is the Main Plaza and to the west the

There is a large horse seated on a throne here.  The horse prances
proudly as you enter.  For such a large estate, it seems strange that
there are not any workers scurrying around looking busy.  In fact it is
rather quiet.  Only the statues and the Horse are here to greet you.  A
man walks by and whispers that Hercules is the only worker employed by
Nero.  It must be truly a Herculean task to keep this place in order.
Paths lead in all directions into the countryside, while to the east you
can see the edges of town.

sheltered from the elements.  It seems to be a cave of a burrow of some
sort.  A strong smell of death and decay comes from the mouth of the
cave.  The wind begins to increase in force from the west and the stench
becomes overpowering.  You realize whatever is making that horrid stench
must be a formidable creature.

blank and omnious stare.  You can see corpses of several ferocious

some horrible beast, but there seems to be no sign of him now.  As you
take a second glance at the mound you see a suspicious hole concealed by
some debris.  The hole seems to be the home of some great monster, and
judging by the scales scattered around it only one thing comes to mind.
That must be the home of a DRAGON!!!

stacked in a strange pattern.  A treacherous trail slowly winds towards
the summit of Mt Olympus.  As you stare to the sky and the peak of Mount
Olympus, you can see flickers of lightning in the background.  Another
trail leads into a dark cave and rapidly descends out of sight.  There
is also a trail that leads into a spooky forest to the west.  Finally
another trail leads east to a familiar place.

Hera's Vengeance Room~
This is the room of Hera, wife of Zeus.  There seem to be no walls in
this room, only open scenes of several events.  All of them are focussed
on beautiful women.  In each of the scenes, the woman is being carefully
trailed and watched by a shadowy figure.  Another scene catches your eye
and it suddenly glows red.  Hera immediately looks at the scene and
begins to tremble with anger.  The scene depicts Zeus and a young woman
talking by a beautiful pond.  Suddenly Hera screams, turns towards you
and looks as if she is going to take vengeance on YOU!

thousands of grape trees here, in perfect form.  There is a huge grape
press that is carefully monitored by a group of slaves.  To your right

middle of the chamber.  Sitting on the edge of the basin is Dionysus the
Graecian god of wine.  He nods and gets another glass from the basin.

Bird Isle~
You have arrived on a small rocky island inhabited only by birds.  The
island is very small and you can only see winged forms in the sky.  You
wonder what these bird find for food, but by looking at all of the bones
on the island, you realize they are well fed.  Closer inspection of the
bones reveals that they are predominantly HUMAN!

You quickly duck for cover as an armed man passes you.  He is heading to
a huge lighthouse which is to your south.  To the west you can see the
cause for all the activity.  There is a huge fortress that rises out of
sight into the mountains on this strange island.  You can tell that this
must be the location of the pirates secret base.

into the fortress to the west.  You suddenly realize that if you can see
that far, so can the pirates!  You try to hide in a closet as a group of
pirates enter the lighthouse, but you are too late.  They have spotted
you and rush to defend their home.

You have entered a large room that serevs as the common room for the
pirates.  There are dozens of men in here.  Some are sleeping, others
are gambling at tables.  One of them looks up and says "Hey, you are not
supposed to be here."  As he finishes speaking, some of the pirates jump
up to attack, while others flee to the south.  You can see two other
exits going north and south.

   You are standing outside an ancient tollbooth, which must have once served 
to charge travellers on thier journeys through the forest of Mirkwood.  
Now, 100 years of neglect have left nothing but the walls of the place 
still standing.  The path it guards leads north and south.

On a dark road~
   You are standing on a dark road, that leads north and south through the
forest of Mirkwood.  To the north, you can barely make out some sort of
building, while to the south you can see the road continue cutting its way
through the forest.

The road continues in each of those directions.

Mindflayer way~
   You are standing on Mindflayer way, a fearsomely named road indeed!  The
road continues to the east and west, and you can see a large swamp to the

   You are standing in the middle of Mindflayer way, which leads east and
west through Mirkwood.  To the south, you hear strange noises, slithers and
splashes, as if huge creatures were wandering through the swamp.  It would 
appear that there is no way to reach the swamp from here, the water is too
deep.  Perhaps you should be thankful for that!

   You are standing at the temporary end of Mindflayer way.  Not that it has
actually ended, mind you, but the passage is blocked by huge trees that have
fallen and completely blocked passage to the west.  It looks like someone
has half-heartedly tried to chop a path through the tree trunks, but it looks
like it will be years before they are completely chopped through.

On An Ancient Path~
    This is an ancient path. Rocks and boulders are strewn about, yet
the middle of the path shows signs of wear from the many travelers and
horses that have passed this way throughout millenia.  The path is dim,
and some light may be required up ahead. Fresh droppings from a
strange animal abound here.  It's tracks are not large, but instead,
seem claw-like. The trees nearby seem strange as well; almost lifelike.
There is an especially large tree to the west.

are piled up in massive heaps here. The chamber of Brackenred appears in
obvious disuse. It has become a haven for rats and other scurrying animals. A
ritualistic symbol is attached to the door. No one seems to have been in here
in quite a long while.

Skexie Challenge Instructions Room~
   There are six signs on the wall here which explain the Challenge of the
Skexies. You are encouraged to read each of the six (Numbered "sign1" through
"sign6"), and attempt the appropriate challenge. The Challenge of the Skexies
is designed as a on-going quest. Your fair play and honesty is appreciated, as
well as expected. When you decide you are ready to try a Challenge, you will
find the entrance beyond the Skexie Lair.

sign1~
     The Challenge of the Skexies is designed as an on-going
quest for people levels 10 to 50. The Challenge area is separated
into three Challenge zones. The first zone is meant for levels 10
to 20. The second for levels 20 to 40, and the last, most difficult
challenge , is meant for levels 40+. In each zone you will find 9
Challenges to be completed. After successfully completing each
challenge you will earn a badge (bronze badges for Challenge 1,
silver badges for Challenge 2, and gold badges for Challenge 3).
The badges are numbered and you must collect all the badges
(of the appropriate color) to earn the Challenge prize. There is
one prize for each class for each of the three Challenge zones
(i.e. The Warrior's prize for Challenge 3, the most difficult, is
The Purple Shard). The prizes will be well worth your risk of life.
~
E
sign2~
   Players must enter each challenge room alone. The rooms are
private (i.e. One player per room), and you may not in anyway
receive help from another player. You may not attempt a challenge
unless you are in the required level range. Challenge Prizes and
badges are not tranferable, and have no monetary value. Do not attempt
to give your Challenge prizes to another player. Any such action
will cause you to lose any Challenge prize you currently have,
plus you will lose the right to complete future Challenges (if any).
To redeem your prize you must contact an Immortal with the ability
to load the prize. The prizes do not naturally exist in the game.

~
E
sign3~
   Any God which discovers you abusing the Challenge is empowered
to punish you in any reasonable way they see fit. The Challenge
of the Skexies is an innovative idea in mudding. It has never been
done before. Your full cooperation and honesty are required to
make the Challenge a fun and exciting area. The last three signs
are introductions to each of the three Challenge zones. Read them
carefully. Most of all, bring many healing potions with you.
Also, you needn't complete the entire challenge at one sitting
(the badges can be rented). Simply bypass the challenges you have
already completed, and continue with the first one that you need.

GOOD  LUCK!

The Gelfling Cleric's Abode~
A Gelfling cleric lives in this room. The rough cave walls are lined with
ritualistic symbols, and other artifacts. A mat lies in one corner, presumably
where the cleric sleeps. The Gelfling visit the cleric to seek counsel and
healing.

An Unused Gelfling Cave~
   This room has not been cleared of stalactites or stalagmites. The ground is
muddy and the room is especially cold. Drawings decorate the small cave area.
This room seems to get little use. A white line is drawn on the floor. Beyond
which you are not recommended to go.

   One mean, crazy Gelfling lives here. There is a huge mess. Nothing like
you have ever seen. The walls have been sanded down. Straw padding lines the
wall. You have a sudden urge to throw yourself against the wall. You change
your mind just in time.

   This is the home of Gilkey. Gilkey is a well known warrior among the
Gelfling.  The cave has been decorated with an unusual rug. Braziers light
the room to a dim level. White silk covers the ceiling. Water drips from the
silk cover into a large bowl. It makes for an interesting waterfall of sorts.

quite dangerous (spikes and wires etc.) There are metal working instruments
about, and a large forge with attached billows for crafting weapons. The heat

Eastern mountains.  The shaft leads in an east west manner, and there
is a definite downward slope to the east.  The twin rails in the floor
stop here, and a crude platform of wooden planks extend deeper into

Northern Entrance to Gypsy Village~
You are standing at the Northern Entrance to the Gypsy Village. You see
a set of small, makeshift gates to the south which mark the official limit
of the small village. You see that the road south appears to be heavily
used by wagons, as their wheels have carved deep ruts into the ground. The
village seems to be made of an odd mixture of buildings and wagons. The 
Gypsy Trail leads south, into the village, and a small field lies to the 
north. You notice a small sign posted on the rickety gates of the village.

up by a large swamp. You wonder what mystical swamp can grow to cover a
road so quickly, that it still looks well used. One thing is for sure,
and that is that no one can use the road to the north anymore. It is
almost as if the swamp has a purpose here. To the south, you can make
out a small village of caravans.
A sign has been posted at the edge of the swamp.

with the Lord of Ravenloft be cut, in an attempt to diminish his evil
power in this land. The High Lords of the Mages' Caravan created this
swamp as a boundry, to ensure that the wishes of the Council would be
heeded. If you are foolish enough to enter, beware, for death lies at
every turn. If you survive the pits of quicksand, you may still be 
caught for all eternity. If you somehow make it through our boundry, then
good luck at surviving the wrath of the Lord of Ravenloft.

that doesn't drift with the breeze. Just looking at the castle gives you
a chill. The only exits are south into the swamp, and north on the path.

It is glowing and a mist is swirling around inside of it.  You first seem to
think it's a moongate, but why are there guards here?  Why are they looking
at you and the portal funny?  The commander tells you, "Don't enter the
Portal, none have returned.  Do as you wish, but we won't stop you."

has hues of purple, obsidan, blood red, violet, and amber.  The furnisings

In the crater, by metallic structure~
You are at the bottom of a large crater.  A large metallic structure is in 
the center of the crater.  There is an open portal, west of you, in the
structure's otherwise seamless surface.

Dragavon's Inner Chamber~
A GOD lives here?  In THIS mess?  This is easily the largest pile of . . .
stuff you have ever seen.  Things are strewn about with little or no regard
for size, breakability or value.  There are scorch marks on the higher
walls, proof that the resident is one of True Dragons.  You get the feeling
that if you rummaged around in here long enough, you could find just about
anything.

lone computer screen and keyboard here.  A small red light is blinking on 
the keyboard; I think that means the computer is down.

with a strong iron gate in between; wicked, barbed spikes protruding up and
down along every other bar - like the hungry jaws of some demented 
nether-beast.
   Temple Road runs north and south from here, its dull, cobbled surface
visually muted by the windblown dust which forms a thin line over its flat
surface.  Eastward, you see the Temple of Mordilnia, in all its modest and
holy splendor.

feet have tread its surface, both bare and shod.  The high-domed ceiling
shows a sky of many shades and hues.
   Midway from floor to ceiling, a balcony-like second floor stands, hand
woven tapestries adorning the smooth granite walls.  From here to the floor
above, a grand, spiralling stairway ascends, its polished cherrywood surface
casting a multitude of tiny daggers of reflected light into your eyes.
   Through the arched portal to the west, one can venture to Temple Road,
and the MidWest Gate, leading far out through the wilderlands.

oak you've ever seen in a largely populated area.  It's singularity seems to
make it some sort of symbolic presence, like a talisman of ultimate nature
grasped cruelly in the stony talons of society.
   The road continues from here, both to the north and the south.

the center of Mordilnia, and a bit past it.
   The sounds of a forge can be heard nearby, and you wince at the deafening
revertebrations of the hammer as it meets the anvil, sending a ringing sound
through the streets, a sound not unlike that of heavy weaponry clashing
furiously in battle.

surrounding Mordilnia, with a strong, steel frame stairway leading up to the
front door of the establishment.
   Though the cobbled stone street here is shadowed by the building above it,
the stones have an almost supernatural polished gleam to them, as if
advertising the wares bought and sold daily just atop the stair...

surface in the past.  The building is illuminated by many small candles
hanging from oaken pillars, giving the room a warm, cheery glow.  Many

candelabras which hold herb-scented, multicolored candles of a respected
and lovely craft.  Vast, almost limitless tomes containing holy knowledge
fill countless shelves, as well as statuettes depicting deities of every
pantheon and creed.
   At the front of the shop, for that is the true purpose of this otherwise
saintly abode, sits a small, mahogany desk scarred by many years of loving
use by quill and scroll.

At the southern edge of the stage, you see a podium, its ebony surface a
grim testament to the death which has been dealt here.
   In the center of the wooden stage, a guillotine stands, solemnly waiting
for its wicked blade to bite into flesh and bone.  Spectators of past
decapitations have always gasped at the meaty thump of a severed head
falling into the blood-lined interior of the bucket below.
   East of here, you see Phantom Road.  East Avenue runs south into South

the Town Common to the west.

who seek rest or socialization often venture.  You see many indications of
past loungings, such as soft indentations in the grass where someone has
briefly taken seat for lunch or small talk.  Small, wild flowers grow in
dense, well-distributed patches throughout the common, giving you a picture
of simplistic beauty.
   A great, towering oak resides west of here, shading that part of the
common and providing an adequate place of slumber.  The only irony to these
sights is the existance of the sadistic tool of death just east of here, a
great chopping block for those of unruly nature.

At The Great Oak~
   You stand at the thick base of the gargantuan Great Oak.  Its trunk is as
thick as any building in Mordilnia, a testimony to its great age.  None of the
inhabitants know how or why it is here, but some have guessed that it was
planted millennia ago by a wisened race of Druidic creatures, as a legacy of
their passing, and some traveller set up camp at its base, eventually deciding
to stay, building Mordilnia as a whole around this central figurehead of
nature and beauty.  No one has dared bring blade against this tree, for some
unspoken law, or perhaps a Druidic ritual, has forbade it.
   The Town Common lies east of here, shaded by the branches of the oak, while
the Temple Road is to the west.

at the thought of your neck under the blade.  To the southeast, you see a
sign claiming that the door beneath it leads to the Bank of Mordilnia.

East Avenue~
   You are standing on East Avenue.  The street runs north, where you can
see a guillotine at its end, and southward to South Street.  Glancing to the
east, you see the reputable Bank of Mordilnia.

The Bank of Mordilnia~
   You stand in the lavishly furnished bank of Mordilnia.  Soft, leather
upholstered couches line the walls, though they seem to show no signs of use,
past or recent.  The carpeted floor and paneled walls, accompanied by the
soft glow of the illuminating wall lamps suggest wealth and prosperity.  A
single, barred window lies to the east, behind which the bank teller makes
note of and executes all transactions.
   Through the door to the west, you see East Avenue.

Intersection: East Avenue and South Street~
   You stand at an intersection, looking intently at your surroundings for
a hint of where you should travel.  East Avenue runs north from here,
eventually to the infamous executioner's block.  South Street runs both
west and east.  Along the westernmost section of te street, you see a few
shops and other buildings, while eastward the road abruptly ends, meandering
to the south, onto the Guild Roads.

place has much wealth.

   To the northwest, you see an alchemy shop.  The faint scent of sulphur and
exotic spices wrestle with your sense of smell.

that is pulsating through the atmosphere.  Some sort of hallucigenic residue
floats through the air here, for your vision blurs and colors change; from
magenta to fuscia, to every visible color imaginable.
   The sign of the shop to the north seems to waver and dance writhingly, and
the cobbled stones beneath your feet seem to shift restlessly, as if they
were tiny, sentient beings, set on carrying your weight with only their sheer
size in numbers.  Then a fresh wind tugs at your face and through your hair,
and all is normal in the world once again.

   As you stand in this dim, musty room, you discover that the cloying
smells of exotic spices and strange chemicals are not as strong as they are
out on the street.  In fact, this doesn't look to be a laboratory of any
sort, so the room where the various potions and other oddities are made must
be located in the back somewhere, with a ventillation shaft extanding above
the shop.
   Here, you see strange, arcane symbols attached to the walls here and there
along with shelves full of bottled liquids and jarred powders.  A large,
stone-carved counter lies in the center of the room, with neatly stacked
papers and other secretarial paraphanelia lining its top.
   To the south, you see the street.

walls are made of a hard, granite-like substance.  The northern door, which
leads into the main room itself, is crafted of a sturdy wood which has been
sanded and finished to a gleaming shine.  On either side of the door, exquisite
marble columns as big around as an average sized tree hold up the ceiling
above your head, so beautiful and yet so stonily strong and cold.

The Room of Shadowed Pasts~
   The room is filled with a thick cloud of smoke, spewing forth from a
large urn filled with exotic incense and dried spices.  The smoke and its
pleasant odor do not fill you with dull, meditative thoughts.  Rather, they
sharpen your senses, hone your instincts...make you slightly paranoid.
   Instruments of the thieving trade line the walls and rest upon tables
throughout the room, but you can tell they are not of high-quality; mere
toys for trainees.  All is quiet here, as is the way of the silent and
sure thief.

The Room of Magical Arts~
   You are standing in a large room, full of scrolls and inkwells, arcane
runes and the like.  Large, oaken tables line the walls, cluttered with 
unfinished scrolls and alchemaecal experiments.  Over in one corner of the
room, a circle of candles containing a chalked pentacle lie undisturbed, a
circle of summoning.  Large portriats of past mages unleashing powerful
dweaomercraeft upon their foes hang on the walls, as do strange words of advice
for powerful spells.

The Chamber of War~
   You stand in a fortress-like room, walled with reinforced iron, and
adorned with a multitude of deadly and artfully crafted weapons.  Double-
edged swords and serrated blades, as well as huge axes of war and weapons
designed to literally crush the life out of one's opponent are carefully,
and almost lovingly cleaned and displayed in museum-fasion in glass cases
and velvet-lined chests.  Large, bulky suits of armor rest on quilted tables
and crates, as well as some that have been put up on display.
   The room is strangely clean, though that is due to the fact that if it
were not, weapons and armor both would go to ruin in a dry heap of crimson
rust and corrosion.

The Entryway to The Guild of Clerics~
   You are standing at the entryway of the Guild of Clerics; a guild of priests
whom have devoted their lives to adventuring and the art of healing.  An aura
of extreme holiness radiates from the walls of this place.
   The roof above you is made of finely polished ceramic tile, while the
walls are made of a hard, granite-like substance.  The eastern door, which 
leads into the main room itself, is crafted of a sturdy wood which has been
sanded and finished to a gleaming shine.  On either side of the door, exquisite
marble columns as big around as an average sized tree hold up the ceiling

   You stand within a small shrine, dedicated to no specific deity, yet to
all gods known throughout the realms.  Marble arches and granite columns
add to the grand scene of holiness, as does the gold and silver altar in
the center of this vast room.  Clerics of every creed and social class
kneel before the precious oracle, heads bowed in silent prayer, awaiting
their magical reward for fufilling their religous duties.

on the walls where they are positioned.  Looking over the balcony, you feel
an extremely vivid rush of vertigo as you see the temple floor below.
   The mahogany staircase leads downward, while bright rays of multicolored
light flit playfully from its surface, reflected from the sunlight that floats
down through the stained glass dome above.

   Just outside of the canopy of trees, your feet trod upon an ages old road,
unpaved and eroded, leading south into the town of Mordilnia.  Perhaps the
sign at the bridge is obsolete, for you see no sign of the bandits it warned
of, not even an old footprint.

   There is an ominous whistling as the wind whips through the dead trees
here.  Though they sport no leaves, the trees completely block out the sky
as their branches interlock.  You neither see or hear any wildlife in this
area, giving you the feeling that all is not well.  The path leads north, to
a stone bridge, and west through the forest.

A trail through the light forest~
   You stand at the beginning of a long path leading out of the forest, and
eventually to the city of Mordilnia.  A gentle, but chilling breeze blows
through the dark, heavy oaks which border the path, casting their sinister
shadows over everything around.  The path continues southward, over a bridge,
then curves toward the west.

sun shines gently through the trees sending dancing, golden beams rippling
across the shadowy grass while midges dance between the branches. A path
leads southward, to a bridge and beyond, while civilization can be found to
the north.

A decaying bridge~
   You have reached the remains of a bridge crossing the River of Midgaard.
From here you can look upstream toward Midgaard and see where the river
emerges from under the city wall.  The water, cold and dark, rushes through
the narrow channel created by the bridge and the large stones that have
fallen from the pilings.  The wood looks rotted and groans loudly with
every step.  On the south side of the bridge the road rises suddenly up a
steep bank.

stairs which ascend to the south.  The front of the first step is decorated
with a carving of a human skull.
   To the north, an archway has been carved out of the rock wall.

The Hall of Challenging~
   You are in a large, oval-shaped chamber.  Tapestries, depicting scenes of
single combat, hang from the roof of the chamber, which is high overhead.  A
vast array of weapons and armor, from various ages, adorn the walls all about
you.  The arena is ringed with torches, burning silently.
There is an archway leading south.
There is a heavy wooden door, made of cedar and overlayed with gold, at the
northern end of the Hall.

marble pillars line the eastern and western walls of the chamber.
   At the northern end of the hall is a dais, made from a single round slab of
pure gold.  There is a crystal pedestal in the center of the dais.  To the

Before the Ruined Gates of Skara Brae~
   You are standing before a pair of large, thick wooden gates, which have
somehow been obliterated and ripped asunder by a great, unknown power.  The
walls of the city are charred and fragmented, and large chunks of it lie in
your path.  You feel an overwhelming sense of impending doom, though, from
the looks of your surroundings, that sense has been late in coming.
   Eastward, through the ruined gates lies the rest of the defiled, charred
city, while westward lies the horizon-reaching greenery and prosperity of the
surrounding forest.

Skara Brae~
   Standing just inside of the city's skeletal cadaver, you can't suppress a
shudder, as the fire blasted buildings and streets loom into view.  The foul
reek of scorched wood and ruptured sewers permeates the atmosphere, fitting
easily with the sights before you.  Shattered and gutted buildings lie in
rubbled heaps, like the ravaged playthings of an angry child.
   The road continues westward, through the decimated gates and into the
forest.  The road also continues eastward, its name obscured by the thick
dust and rubble of past chaos.

Skara Brae~
   You stand on a cracked and blackened road within the walls of Skara Brae.
The air here makes you gag, its foul stench originating from the depths of the
breached sewage pipes beneath the surface of the road.  Destruction lies all
around you, as far as you can see, and a strong fear grips your bowels, and
your skin develops gooshflesh as you think of what could do this.
   East of here is an intersection between two now-nameless roads, while west
leads out of this wretched place.

Skara Brae~
   You stand at an intersection of two streets.  Shattered cobblestones and
planks from collapsed buildings partially block the way north, but there is
enough room to maneuver through in that direction.  The stretch of road to the
south is unobstructed, but there is really nothing more than a large patch of
dry, bare earth, where the cobblestones once were.
   Directly to the east, you see one of the few remaining standing structures
in Skara Brae.  It appears to have been a home at one time, but you are not
certain, as it has been blackened and torn beyond recognition or salvage.  The
road to the west leads out of Skara Brae, and out of sight of the horrible
destruction which surrounds you.

above a once-thriving establishment has come loose, and is now swaying on
rusted, heat-twisted hinges.
   This road ends just north of here, but continues far to the south.  Another
road branches off to the west.

it now appears to be a strange labyrinth of sorts, as the flattened buildings
on the northern and southern sides of the road now serve quite efficiently as
crude, scorched walls.
   Farther east, the road leads into a large, open area, like a market plaza.

   You are on a heat-cracked road.  The ground beneath your feet reminds you of
the parched sands of the desert, but what lies beneath your feet is a cobbled
stone road.  You find yourself pondering the magnitude of power expended on
the grim task of destroying a whole city in such a manner.
   The road runs both east and west from this point, but eastward, it opens
into a large, extremely chaotic area.  It appears to have once been a center
of trade and religion.

   You stand at the end of a broken road.  The destruction east of here is
immense, as it was once the Gran Plaz, where an abundance of shops, temples,
and homes once stood.  The Plaz, as far as you can tell, no longer exists.
Instead, you see a barren, rubble-strewn landscape filled with blackened and
twisted shaped.
   The road ends at the Plaz, and leads back to the main sector of Skara Brae,
west of here.  There, the destruction is less than at the Plaz, but it is still
amazingly chaotic.

   You are standing on the barren remains of the Gran Plaz.  Once famed for its
variety of temples and assorted shops, the Plaz now lies in shattered ruin.
   The awesome destructive power which has crushed the entire city of Skara
Brae did not spare this section any more than it did any other.  Broken homes
lie silent, crumbled and charred beyond repair.  Temples at which the citizens
came to worship the Gods are now worthless heaps of blasted rock and scorched
memories.
   The few survivors of the chaotic catastrophy seem to have labored hard to
gather what little was left, for all around you lie the shattered remnants of
a once-proud city; nothing of personal value or affinity was left.
   The Plaz extends as far as you can see both to the south and east from here.
To the west, you see a road leading toward the outskirts of town.

The Gran Plaz~
   You are standing on the barren remains of the Gran Plaz.  Once famed for its
variety of temples and assorted shops, the Plaz now lies in shattered ruin.
   The awesome destructive power which has crushed the entire city of Skara
Brae did not spare this section any more than it did any other.  Broken homes
lie silent, crumbled and charred beyond repair.  Temples at which the citizens
came to worship the Gods are now worthless heaps of blasted rock and scorched
memories.
   The few survivors of the chaotic catastrophy seem to have labored hard to
gather what little was left, for all around you lie the shattered remnants of
a once-proud city; nothing of personal value or affinity was left.
   The Plaz extends as far as you can see to the north, east, and west.

The Gran Plaz~
   You are standing on the barren remains of the Gran Plaz.  Once famed for its
variety of temples and assorted shops, the Plaz now lies in shattered ruin.
   The awesome destructive power which has crushed the entire city of Skara
Brae did not spare this section any more than it did any other.  Broken homes
lie silent, crumbled and charred beyond repair.  Temples at which the citizens
came to worship the Gods are now worthless heaps of blasted rock and scorched
memories.
   The few survivors of the chaotic catastrophy seem to have labored hard to
gather what little was left, for all around you lie the shattered remnants of
a once-proud city; nothing of personal value or affinity was left.
   The Plaz extends as far as you can see in all directions.

Darkenelf's Demense~
   Although this room is deep beneath the ground, Darkenelf's home is quite
warm, if a bit odd.  Intricate rugs from faraway lands cover the floor, save
for the center, which is a spiralling downward stairway.
   Tapestries as intricate as the rugs, if not more so, alsmot completely
cover the walls, each telling its own complex story.  A chest lies open on
one side of the room, containing many maps and scrolls, as well as a few
jewels and a strange dagger.
   Beside Darkenelf's desk, you see a long table, covered with vials of odd,
strange liquids; some bubbling, some glowing, others making wretched noises.
   On the desk itself, you see rolls of parchment, jars of multicolored ink,
feathered quills, and a few assorted gems.  On the upper section of the desk
rests a lagre reptillian skull on a pedastle, next to which is an ominously
large crystal sphere.
   Southward, you see a rune-covered oaken door.

The Temple of The Mad God~
   You stand in a small, dismal shrine, dedicated to The Mad God, Tarjan.
This being one of few buildings standing in Skara Brae, and being in the best
condition, shows Tarjan's grasping hold over this realm just as well as did
the destruction of the city.
   The sleek, black marble walls of this unholy place glisten as though they
were covered in dimly illuminated rivulets of blood.  The very air of this
place reeks of foulness, though it appears to be thoroughly clean.  Strange
rune patterns are etched carefully into the walls' surfaces.  Their pattern
seems to change as you look at it, so their meanings are indecipherable.
   Two doors, one north, one south, made of blackened iron stand here, each
with a legend written above it.  The northern door has been labelled 'Chaos',
and the southern door has written above it, 'Tarjan'.
   To the west, just outside of the temple, you can see the doomed city of
Skara Brae, solemnly awaiting the end of eternity.

The Southern Stairwell~
   You stand in a small, musty room.  The cobwebs here are covered with thick,
ancient dust, which periodically floats down to make you sneeze.  Thick patches
of moss and various fungi cling precariously to the stone walls here, glowing
slightly from the phosphorescence they emit.
   North of here, you see the main room of the temple, while to the south lies
an ancient granite stairway, leading down to the catacombs.

The Catacombs~
   A whiff of musty dead air emerges from all around you.  Puffs of dust rise
with each footfall on the floor - here is an area that seems not to have known
the passage of a living soul in decades.
   The passage heads east from here, obviously constructed with care in some
distant age.  All in all, you feel a terrible sense of death all around you.

The Cavernous Lair of The Mighty Skylar~
   You stand within the dark recesses of a gargantuan, sinister cavern of
immense proportions.  The very size of the place seems to create a darkness
which devours nearly all light which is cast at its gloom.  Cold, stale air
floats trough the air, its dead, sterile taste making you have thoughts of
ancient, dusty-dry tombs.
   Huge stalagmites and stalactites protrude from the floor and ceiling of
the cavern, formed over millennia by the constant, miniscule trickle of chill,
stagnant water from a source far up on the surface lands.  In the distance, the
roar of a mighty waterfall can be heard, though it can not be seen from here,
its chilling mists somehow grasp hold of your flesh, like dead, clammy hands,
even from this distance.  You can feel an ancient, omnipotent power at work
here.  It is not one of evil, or even that of good.  It is a power known
throughout the ages, yet forgotten, or cast aside, like a bane of ill tidings.

A Leader Strand~
     This strand is weightier, more sturdy.  It shimmers as you step on
it.  You are definitely not in the Midgaardian realms anymore.  Just
where you are you can't tell.  It feels like you're moving through
ether.  You can still get back down to more surer lands.

lying about.  You feel that humans have been played with here too,

	If you really hate it here,

	Hint: If normal laws of space and physics don't apply,

 strong and robust, especially compared to the sickly little cedar tree
 opposite it on the path.  Strangely, though, the trees hover above the muddy
 ground, as if they want no connection with the mud.  There is a small table in

CSE 211~
 You are standing on what appears to be the main computer lab at the University
 of Florida.  There are rows going back a considerable distance from the front.
 On the left is a small cluster of IBM PS/2 computers.	There appear to be
 graduate students punching away at the keys, each typing their own little
 dissertation.	Most are almost ready to use the laser printer.  Further back,
 also on the left, are a cluster of Macintosh computer systems.  On the right
 you see lettered rows with 8 different VT220's stretching across each lettered
 row.  The screens vary in color from amber to green to white.	About halfway
 down the letters, IBM XT's may be found along with a few PS/2's scattered
 throughout the lot.  From the last two rows of VT220's you hear a low constant
 murmur as people discuss SillyMUD, the latest MBBS postings, the next FORTRAN
 project, and life in general.

An old Cathedral stands in front of you.
This magnificent building must reach a hundred feet above the clouds.
As you look up and down the walls of this fascinating structure you wonder
how such an old building could look as if it was just built. You could spend
hours if not days just looking at the stained glass paintings of the Christian
savior Jesus , his diciples , Michael the Archangel , and other obviously Holy
figures who you have no idea who they are. It's incredible how over the years
this building stayed so perfectly intact. Your curiousity begs you to enter.
A closed wooden door seems like the only entrance.

I am glad you have found the Entrance to the Catacombs.
But alas, they have not yet been completed.
The first level of the catacombs is aimed at the low-mid level adventurer
( level 8-15 )
The levels beyond that ... Well.. Maybe a mid level ( 10+ ) will be able to
kill some of the mobs.. but is intended for 30+

In the meantime explore old-town .. For I am sure you haven't found everything.

There are TOUGHIES here!   ;)

Under the Shack~
The smell of mildew and rotting flesh is amist.
A tunnel runs east and west, you must be 5 feet tall if you have any hope of
standing completly upright as you wander through them.
You pray that your light source doesn't go out.

Now after many years only the things that aren't of much use lie
here under a thick layer of dust. There is a fireplace in the
north wall over which a large painting hangs. The only apparent

Beside a tiny campsite~
Dug into the side of a side of the hill to the west, this campsite
offers protection from the elements.  To the east lies a gravel road
which descends southwards.  A small campfire still flickers here,

Outside the gates of a gnome village~
The unmistakable architecture of the gnomes makes the tiny city to the
south incredibly beautiful to behold.  Nestled in a valley, the village's
solid colors sharply contrast the multi-hued chaos of the exotic plants
dotting the surrounding country-side.  To the north a gravel road ascends
out of the valley.  To the south lie the gates of the village.
The gates seem to be closed while the village is under construction.

and appears not to have noticed you.  The only exit is to the north.

A Candle-lit Hallway~
    The candle-lit hallway continues here, and the candles blow out just
as a large gust of wind eminates from the east.  The only way to find
out where the gust came from is to follow the hallway, as you decide
to do.

The Altar Of Bob~
    This huge room seems to be where the gust originated from.  Along
the east wall, on top of a golden altar, sits a statue of the zombie
god bob.  It is so tall that the cieling of this building had to
be removed to that it could stand up.  The altar seems to be quaking
under the mighty weight of the statue.  To the south, you see another room,
and to the west, the candle-lit hallway.

a mist covering everything leads.  To the east, a plain hallway winds

right before your eyes.  Never before have you seen such gore.  The

Southern End of Coridoor~
   At this end of the hall, you come to a huge door, made entirely of
gold and silver. A small keyhole is set into the left side of the
door. The air seems to crackle with magical energy, the door resists
all of your attempts to enter without the proper key. As you reach
out to touch the door, you feel a sharp pain run through your body,
thoughts of death and great evil race through your mind. You hear an
evil laugh from beyond the door.

Castle Throne Room~
   As you enter the room you notice several symbols and markings
of unholy nature. The room is light enough to see, but rather dim.
A huge pentacle is layed out upon the floor, the dwemor of some evil
magic is in the air. At the far back of the room, you see a brilliant
throne of crystal, strange runes of gold are set into the throne. Your
heart stops for a moment as you notice the decayed, skeletal form of a
lich seated in the throne, the red glow of its eyes fixed dead upon you.
With a quick motion of its hand, the door from which you entered,
magically forms into a stone wall. the only exit is an ornate door set
into the wall behind the throne of the lich! An evil laugh echoes
through the air.

of solid platinum. The room is furnished with a pair of crossed swords
on the right wall, while on the left is a picture of a young warrior

A Barren Room~
   You have entered an ordinary room, the walls are unfurnished
and the floor bare. You seem to sense some sort of magic
in the air upon entering. The only exit from the room lies
back to the south.

Secret Passage~
   Suddenly, you find yourself in a hidded passage somewhere 
beneath the guild. The walls are covered with many fine tapestries.
The floor of the room is of solid oak, and looks quite sturdy.
Looking further down the passage, you can see nothing, for the
passage reaches out of you range of sight.

Secret Passage~
   As you travel farther down the passage, the light of the torches
on the walls begins to grow dim. The passage is deathly quiet, no
sounds are to be heard. Looking further down the hall you can just
barely make out what appears to be a door.

The Svelerian Forest~
   Upon entering this forest, you notice that a strange, glowing
mist lies all about the ground, enveloping the bases of the trees.
You hear the sounds of many creatures from all around you, strangely
enough, none of them are familiar to you.

The Svelerian Forest~
   As you step into this part of the forest, you breath a sigh 
of relief as you realize that you have finally found your way 
through the maze of trees from which you came. One familiar thing
about this part of the forest is that as in the maze before, there
seems to be some sort of winged creature continually watching you
from above. The trees once again begin to thicken here, forming
a path through the neverending trees of this forest.

The Svelerian Forest~
   As you set foot onto the path, the winged figure begins to
follow you once more. Far ahead, through a small opening in the trees
you can make out a tall, majestic tower, rising far above the
treetops. The path is darkened by the thickness of the trees
alowing no light to enter. As you head up the path, you begin
to wonder what lies in the tower ahead.

The Svelerian Forest~
   The trees seem to remain thick here, and there is no sign
of the forest thinning out. Still ahead, you can see the top
of the tower to which you are trying to make your way. The
winged creature the had been following you before, seems 
to have disappeared for the time being.

trees seem to thin out a little, revealing  the entrance to a 
large cavern. Ahead, the forest continues for as far as you can

The Svelerian Caverns~
   As you enter these caverns, you notice the walls of this
portion of the cavern are covered with ancient runes and markings
which you do not understand. The ceiling of the caverns are fairly
high above you, and the cavern seems to glow with a sort of inner
light. Just as you are about to leave, you hear what you think 
are voices somewhere to the west.

voices, this time louder than before. This part of the cavern
seems that it is used often, for the rough edges of the cavern

Caverns Beneath Violet Mountain~
   Here, far beneath the earths surface, you find the fabled caverns
of Violet Mountain.  It is said that these caverns once housed the
late king of Lucenia's most valuable treasures, also the stories of
these caverns also tell of a great dragon being housed within the walls
of these caverns to protect the riches.  If the stories are true, and
and the riches were placed here, then perhaps the treasure is still within
these caverns, also, to your dismay, that would mean the dragon is here
also.

treasures lies here. The ground beneath you trembles slightly
as you hear a loud roar from somewhere far below...

The Hall of Ancients~
   Suddenly, after being summoned by magical forces far beyond
your control, you find yourself in what appears to be the chambers
of someone or something of great power. As you look around you, you
notice that the walls are decorated with many fine tapestries, many
of which bear the likes of the gods of myth and legend on them, The
tapestries seem to stare at you from their eyes, piercing into your
very soul, it is almost as if the tapestries do not just bear the
images of the gods, but that they are looking glasses for them also.
   The floor of the chamber is richly carpeted, and there is a large
throne of black onyx against the wall opposite of you, its many runes
and carvings radiate a strong sence of magic. Although panic-stricken
by the sight of the chamber, and the feeling that had overcome you
upon your arrival, you get a feeling on peace and tranquility, almost
as if the gods themselves were watching over you.

pile of papers stacked upon it spans across the center of the
room.  The iron door stands ajar to the south.

Armory~
This old shop is littered with rusted armor far too old to be usefull.
In addition, this shop's armor does not seem to have been much use
to its previous owners, many of whom are here now.

Towne Square~
Before you is an emense square which hints at the greatness this city once
possesed, when it was a land of the living. Many statues once decorated this
area, but have long since fallen apart, mush like many of this city's 
inhabitants. An empty fountain sits at the centre of the square. While this
was once the intersection of the two main roads of the city, only the one
extending to the north and south remains usable.

At the Front door of a large mansion~
   You stand at the front door or the large home. As you stand directly in 
front of the house, you realize just how big it really is. From the outside, it
looks like it must have 100 rooms in it. A large mat with the word 'Welcome'
on it lies at the foot of the door. A large knocker is directly in front of
you, and a large doorbell sits to the right of the door.

Outside Gilbert's Bar and Grille~
You are standing outside a posh looking Bistro.  Oh, this must be that
restaurant that moved just outside of Midgaard to avoid its more restrictive
"blue laws"-you've heard quite a bit about it.  A bright blue neon sign
with the words: Gilbert's Bar and Grille is illuminated over the doorway
that you can just barely make out through the throng of people standing
between you and it.  Some bouncers are at the door and a doorman stands a
few feet away, causually pointing to members in the crowd and letting
them in.  Apparently, you should have made reservations weeks ago and
without them you'll just have to wait.  In the mean time, you can read
the sign that stands off to one side of the entrence containing a list
of house specialties and a review of tonights entertainment.

You stand in the entryway of the main lounge of Gilbert's.  Off to the west,
where the stage is, seems to be the center of attraction.  On the far side of
the room to the north you discern the world famous bar at Gilbert's.  Some of
the most volatile and succulent drinks in all of Midgaard had their origin 
from the bottles lined up behind that bar.  Both a door and a short flight of
stairs attract your attention on the east side of the room, although from here,
you can't figure out to where they lead.  Tables and diners are scattered
about the main floor, waiters and cocktail waitresses walk amongst them with
difficulty as the place seems to be packed tonight.

The Back Corner of the Main Room~
This is about the most secluded spot you'll find in this room - and still, it's
crowded.  It's difficult to make out what's happening on the stage from here,
and the acoustics are horrible.  It's tough for the waitresses to get all the
way over here from the bar, but the romantically inclined couples here don't 
seem to mind the privacy.  Tables for two are here and booths line the wall.
Above the booths, the walls are covered with various knick-knacks and a closer
inspection would be required to make anything out specifically.  A door lies to
the east with the words "day care" stenciled on it - this strikes you as wierd.

table tables~
Most of the tables are for couples.  They have ashtrays, a vase that may be
crystal (doubtful, it isn't that upscale a place...) with a single red rose
in it.  A tall white candle burns beside each vase.  The utensils on each
table are immaculately lain out, and napkins, folded into the shape of a
flower are lain atop the plate.  It all lends itself to the cozy, romantic
feel that the establishment is trying to invoke.
~
E
walls wall~
There doesn't seem to be much order in what you see.  Deer antlers, sombraro
hats, pictures of people you don't recognize, wooden antiques of dubious
purpose, musical instruments are all tacked to the walls.  A shelf circles
the room high above what you could reach containing more sundry objects that
either didn't fit, or couldn't be fixed to the wall.  A clay pot or two,
some statuary and a large wood and metal farm implement that you're not
sure how could be put to use stand out, but many things you can't identify
are up there too.  You guess all of it is designed as conversation pieces
for when the dinner conversation dries up.

hear beeping and chirping sounds (though just faintly) coming from the 
north.  Tables are placed around the floor and a few booths line the back
wall.  Waitresses taking drink orders and waiters serving food walk amongst
them.

You are immediately opposite of the stage on the other side of the room, but
somehow the beeps, chirps and explosion sounds coming from the east attract
more of your attention at the moment.  This part of the main room is strangely
vacant of seats (maybe because the game room noise overpowers the entertainment
from the stage?)  Three short steps lead downward to the east into a darkened
room where the only lighting comes from the strangely magical windows attached
to the mystical contraptions you see within.

V.I.P. Seating in the Main Room~
Seating in this section of Gilbert's main room is reserved for when famous,
influential or powerful people come to visit the nightclub.  It's situated
ideally far enough away from the limelight of the stage that its guests can
get some privacy if they want it and close enough to the bar that they can
easily get a drink if need be.  The lighting here is more subdued because
the V.I.P's tend not want to be recognized and all of the tables are
roped off and "reserved" even though many of them are empty.  The wall has
many photos hanging on it.

and some of his staff standing next to various prominent figures of 
Midgaard.  The first one you examine contains the autograph "Best wishes,
Lord Python."  The next, "Thanks for a great evening, Earl of Orligesh."
and the next, "Good luck and Thanks, Tiffany."  There seems to be row after
row of such photos, each with a posed picture of some celebrity posing with
Gilbert and shaking hands.  You recognize a good many of them, but some of
them seem vague and you're not sure who the celebrity really is.

The Legendary Gilbert's Bar~
You had heard that the bar was something that had to be seen to be believed,
but this is incredible!  A highly varnished, oaken bar juts out into the room
from the north wall taking up almost all the space available.  Behind the bar,
stand a crew of bartenders carefully making the drinks that were ordered.
What's amazing is that instead of just pouring the drink, most of them are
juggling the bottles as they serve the drink.  One even does acrobatic flips
and yet each of them gets the drink perfect every time.  Behind the bartenders
stands a wall of glass shelving, lit from behind so that the light shines 
through the hundreds upon hundreds of bottles, carafes and decanters of 
alcohol.  You recognize a few well known brand names but most of the bottles
are unfamiliar to you.  A dumbwaiter is on the back wall and a large tap
system is off to one side of the bar.

bar~
When you finally force your way thru the crowd and get close enough to the
bar to look at it, you notice small objects buried just beneath the thick
coat of clear varnish.  Various coins, some unknown but mostly small
denominations of Midgaard's currency, a few photo's, a newspaper clipping
or two, a rainbow colored feather, a pen and a brass key are various
brick-a-brack are just beyond your touch below the surface of the bar.
Subconsciously you also note that despite the huge quantity of sticky
alcoholic bevereges that cross its surface, the bar is surprisingly clean.
Service here is top notch.  Off to one side of the bar is a tap system.
~
E
wall~
Little more than what you saw immediately can be discerned upon closer
inspection.  Since you don't know how they have things organized, you 
couldn't hope to find some specific bottle of alcohol but it seems they
have everything you've ever heard of (and some you haven't.)  A dumbwaiter
is notched into the wall to one side.
~
E
dumbwaiter~
The dumbwaiter must go down to the supply room to restock any of the hundreds
of bottles you see before you.  Too, if someone calls for something rare 
and exotic then that kind of bottle is kept down below as well.  It isn't
often that the bartenders need to have something brought up because
virtually anything they could need they have on hand at their fingertips.
The running joke is that if you can describe a drink that they don't have
the ingredients for, they'll give it to you free.
~
E
tap system~
Literally 50 tap levers are arranged in neat rows and connected by long 
hoses that run under the floor to the supply room beneath.  Dozens of
beers, soft drinks, and other bevereges flow from one of these faucets.
You name it, they have it.

The Red-Light Section of the Main Room~
Well, this is different.  The decorum in this corner of the room has gone 
from posh and elegant to sleezy and erotic.  The lighting is all very
subdued, somewhere between dim and non-existant, except for one bright
red lightbulb lit up over the doorway to the north.  You can't see what's
beyond because of the curtain of beads hanging in the doorway.  In
addition, a door to the west marked "No Admittance! Authorized Personnel
Only" catches your attention briefly.  You can't make out the stage at all
from here, but that's ok, because the main source of entertainment here
seems to be the "escort girls" and "table waittresses".  Every so often,
one of the girls and a male friend will head thru the doorway to the north
and you catch a glimpse of a raucous party underway just beyond.

Like the rest of the room, it too is falling apart.  Originally made of pine,
it shows signs of age.  An occasional stain indicates where some bottle of

closet clothing~
The closet is filled to overflowing with dresses and costumes of all sort.
Maria flat out refuses to use any of the "common" outfits from wardrobe so
all of her stuff has to be custom made and winds up in here.  Giant,
spangely dresses that characterize Ms. Deveroh's stage act make up the bulk
of the contents.

wall walls photo photographs pictures~
The walls are covered with everything from publicity mug shots of Maria to
old production posters with Maria's likeness on them.  There are dozens
of such pictures.  Interspersed with all of this are various newspaper
clippings which seem to be reviews of Ms. Deveroh's past performances.  Not
coincidentally, all of them heap praises upon Maria.

Backstage~
You are standing in a narrow hallway that is backstage.  There are many ropes
tied to metal weights on the floor.  Following the ropes up with your eyes
you see they are attached to scenery sets that can be raised or lowered as
required by the stage performance. A curtain lies to the east and behind it is
the stage.  The hallway continues to the north heading toward the set department
and the director's room and also to the south toward the dressing rooms.

This is a run-down changing room for the other stage performers.  The paint
on the wall is old and cracked.  In some places, the floor tiles have broken
and the cement underneath shows signs of age and neglect.  There is a vanity

This room is literally filled with fake objects of simple wooden construction
of all types.  What at first appeared to be a tree growing in the middle of the
room you know recognize is nothing more then a cleverly painted balsa wood cut
out.  Walking behind it, you notice it only has one side as well.  In fact,
there are quite a few such objects- a few other trees, some bushes, a rock or
two, an automobile and a horse are all done similarly.  The walls of the room
contain shelving as high as the eye can see filled with various objects.  A
good deal of furniture also lays around.  Chairs, tables, desks, cabinets and
more things then you can count litter the floor.

Gilbert's Back Room~
What kind of a place is this?  Loud music comes from a band playing to the
north and to the northeast you can make out gambling tables.  To the east, lies
a secluded and dimly lit resting place with many couches and raucous laughter
eminating from it.  Clearly each corner of this large back room bares
investigation.  Everywhere you look scantily clad women slink about.  You had
never realized how sexy lace could be (or how little of it it took to cover the
human body for that matter...)  A large mirror is to your left as you enter so
that you may check your comeliness upon entering (or see how disheveled you
look upon leaving.)

Behind the One-Way Mirror~
You search around the wall and finally find a latch that triggers a door to
open and you step inside.  It is pitch-black in here so that the bouncers can
see clearly through the one-way mirror and watch for trouble that may crop up
in the back-room without being immediately obvious.  A stool with some girlie
magazines lying on the floor next to it is all that catches your attention.

Dance Hall~
A five-man band plays any sultry romantic music you'd care to request upon a
low stage.  The stage is set a few inches above a hardwood floor upon which
many couples are dancing.  Everything from the waltz on up to the lambada can
at one time or another (and at times simultaneously) be seen here.  This may
not be the most well known or swank of Midgaard's dance halls, but it is
certainly the most risque.  Men in business suits are moving and swaying
holding women dressed in skin tight body wraps in time to the current number.
It is unclear whether all of the woman dancing here came in with their
gentleman dance partners or not.

Gambler's Corner~
The games of chance which are inappropriate for the otherwise extensive game
room off the main room are all located here.  Judging by the illegal nature of
the games, the concealed place you find them in as well as a host of other
similar reasons, you conclude that the games are probably either heavily fixed
or at very least very much in the house's favor, hence, you elect not to play.
There is a blackjack table with a half dozen people around it.  The dealer is
topless other than his black bow-tie and one of the ladies at the table seems
to be spending more time looking at him than at her cards (you note she's
losing a lot too.)  Two gentleman at the table have women in mini-skirts
clinging to their arms and occassionally bouncing up and down and emitting
little squeals when the cards are in their favor.  A bank of slot machines is
off to oneside with zombie-like humans pumping in gold coin after gold coin,
endlessly awaiting that one big payoff.

Lounge~
A stairway with brassplated hand rails and banisters spirals up into the
ceiling here.  The carpeting turns plush as you step into this corner and an
abundant number of couches and lounges are situated around.  You stand back and
watch an interesting sight, because everytime an unescorted man walks into
this corner, before too long he is joined by some feminine friend and they sit
for a short time and talk or have drinks.  The conversation of most of these
couples is to light for you to overhear much of it, but you have no doubts as
to its content.  On occassion, "consenting adults" proceed up the stairway for
more privacy...

A large metallic table lies in the center of the room for general, all purpose

and measuring devices.  A rack is above the table with pots and pans hanging
from it in neat rows.  You note the table also has a number of drawers in
which you find a plethora of knives, stirring spoons, basters and spatulas-
all neatly arranged.  There is a pantry to the north and the cooking area is
to the south.  A large (and thick) metal door which is cold to the touch blocks

the door is stacked with dirty dishes, a hose nearby removes most of the food
matter and the sinks and the suds are next.  And the drying racks are at the
end of the production chain.  An occasional pot from the kitchen to the east
can also be found amongst the utensils.  General cleaning supplies are stored

        the same exquisite attention here that you yourself will get
        from the rest of our well trained staff.
Apparently day care was added on as a service to parents who found that they
couldn't go out as much anymore because a babysitter was so hard to find.  You
look around and see plenty of things to keep your children occupied.  They'll
get along all right, go enjoy yourself.

Day Care~
Everything a small child could want is here.  There is plenty of room for them
to run around, much to the consternation of the nursemaids trying to keep them
under control, and the padded, sound proof walls keep the children from hurting
themselves or the eardrums of the diners just outside the door.  A shelf with
blocks on and around it lies off to one side and a number of easels for
fingerpainting stands opposite it.  In the center of the room is a low table
for serving juice and cookies, or for just sitting at when you get tired of
doing everything else.  In the south-east corner is what has become known as
Gilbert's Mud Pit (no, not the mud wrestling pit, that's upstairs) where the
kids can play with modeling clay and other forms of muck and be as "creative"
as they want.  Apparently someone's idea of creative extended to most
everything in that corner of the room - barely an a square inch of surface area
remains undecorated.

Entering the Bordello~
You stand at the top of the ornately crafted spiral stairway leading downwards
to the back room of Gilbert's.  A long hallway stretches south.  As you peer
down the hall you notice a number of doors (some open, some closed) leading
off from it.  Two antique oil lamps burn softly beside each doorway.  The
flickering light from which causes your shadow and that of your "guest" to
sway gently as it is cast on the wall and seemingly to intertwine with each
other.  A doorway leads to the west and you feel that is your first stop.

The Jungle Room~
Haven't you always wanted to play Tarzan and Jane?  This is the perfect place
to try out that jungle yell and let out whatever primordial call of the wild
you feel you need to.  The bedposts all look like trees from a rainforest,
and the sheets have the look of a plush covering of leaves.  Vines drop from
the ceiling and cleverly hidden speakers occasionally emit monkey sounds and
other noises from the rainforest.

Swashbuckler's Paradise~
Ahoy Matey!  See any chests you want to ...  plunder?  A mist-maker you can't
seem to find keeps the air moist with a salt spray.  The hardwood floors look
like a ship's planking.  In fact, a large mast rises out of the center of the
room (the loops for lashing anyone needing a flogging...or ...other punishment
are carefully concealed unless you're right next to them.)  A low, wooden
railing running across the room just beyond the mast separates the room in two.
Beyond the rail there is a step down and the remainder of the room is filled
about ankle high with water.  A sandy beach with a lone coconut-bearing palm
tree breaks the surface and serves as the "bed" herein.

Kinkiness at Gilbert's most extreme (bestiality isn't permitted herein.)  A
large, four post, brass bed stands just opposite the doorway.  A collection of
leather thongs and handcuffs of various sizes lies close at hand.  A cabinet
is off to one side and you wonder what it holds.  For the ultimate in sleeze,
Gilbert's Goo Grappling Pit is here.  It defies easy explanation. There is also
a stockade with slots for someone's hands and neck to be placed in while they
are doing "penance."

escape the normal pressures associated with their career here.  Soft, plush

nightstand photograph cases~
The nightstand has a number of momentos from Darcia's distinguished career.
The largest is a 4x8 closeup photo of Darcia when she was much younger with the
words Darcia Sinclair: The Brightest New Star on Gilbert's Stage written
beneath it.  A number of other photos and clippings scattered about lead you
to believe that Darcia was not always the silver fox she is now, but once had a
prestegious stage career as well.  Fame is truly fleeting, you have never
heard of her before.

The Gangsters' Hangout~
You are standing in a moderately sized room somewhere under Gilbert's Tavern.
A large circular table is in the middle of the room that spreads out to either
side of you.  Two doorways can be seen - one in the north-east corner going
east, and another in the south-east corner going south.  A narrow stairwell
leads upwards from the northwest corner.  There is a map of Midgaard on the
north wall and the table has a bunch of papers on it.  This must be where the
mafia guys come to plan their operations.  You suspected Gilbert might be
affiliated with them.

gypsy settlement.  You can't be sure what they mean, but you suspect that it
shows where the mob has activity and which mob boss is behind it.

Wine Cellar~
This small room in the basement is very cool so as to maintain a good
temperature for the large number of bottles, casks, kegs and barrels of liquor
that are stored herein.  The walls all have floor to ceiling wineracks that are
virtually filled.  The center of the room holds the larger bulk quantities of
alcohol.  The north wall also has an opening for a dumbwaiter to supply the
bar above.  Hoses drop through the roof and connect to large, cylindrical
canisters lined up against one wall.

This is a small landing that overlooks the entire shipping and recieving
business of the tavern and mafia set-up.  The warehouse spreads out before you
to the south and you can get a general glimpse of it from here.  A large
number of boxes and crates are stacked up and men run around occasionally
taking one of the crates and moving it somewhere else or stacking a newly
arrived one in the appropriate place.  A door lies to the north and there is a
small office to the west.  Stairs lead down to the south into the warehouse
itself.

Motel VI is a diku-based multi-user dungeon (MUD).  All of which means
that many real people are logged in (just like you) and are interacting
in a sword and sorcery role playing environment.  Please realize that this
is a game and, therefore, entertainment and the people you deal with are
real life so that some rules of conduct apply so that entertainment is
possible for all parties.
 
Your "goal" is: first and foremost to have fun.  This is gone about
by interacting with the other people and creatures of the realm of
Midgaard.  A secondary goal is to gain power and wealth by fighting
the monsters that threaten Midgaard.
 
Two things should be remebered at all times: 1.) This is only a game.
and 2.) You are a human being and are expected to act like one.
~
E
guide monster fighting~
In your travels you will most certainly run across a monster you have
never encountered before.  At times like this, it is a wise decision to
CONSIDER <monster>.  This will give you an evaluation of the level 
difference between yourself and the mobs, and hence, a rough idea
of how difficult it would be for you to kill it.  Quite clearly,
it would be unwise to attack something that is listed as: what do you
want your epitaph to read?  whereas, a monster that is Absolutely,
positively to easy for you is probably a waste of time.
 
Realize however: Con only shows you the level difference between you
and the monster.  It does not take into account either your or the
monster's special abilities and skills (breath weapon, spell casting
ability and the like).  Let the adventurer beware...
 
Also note: grouping is always a possibility for taking out those
mobs that want to find out what to put on your tombstone...  CON
does NOT take into account how powerful your group is, just how
good your chances are alone.
 
And as a final warning: Some CON's are far from true.
~
E
treatise levelling skills~
With perserverance, you will eventually accumulate enough experience to
become a higher level.  It would be a good idea to read the help files
on XP, GAIN and PRACTICE.  
 
You may find out how much experience you need to level by typing
LEVEL <class>.  Experience is gained by fighting and killing monsters.
It can be lossed by dying or by fleeing from a monster.  At present,
you will lose 1/2 of your xp if you die, up to a maximum of 2 million
xp.  Amount lost due to fleeing is based on your level.
 
Note that you MUST go to your guildmaster and GAIN to actually raise a
level, it will not occur until you do so.  Also some skills can be learned
before they can actually be used.  You should make sure to do HELP <skill>
and see if you can use it at your level before you PRACTICE it.

note new players~
Hail, and welcome to MSU's Motel VI, a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) using
diku-code.  In essence, you have just stepped into a role-playing game set
in a sword and sorcery environment.  Like you, there are other people
connected to the game who are adventuring, interacting and having fun.
Your task is: 1.) to equip yourself with food armament and items of
magic; 2.) explore Midgaard and its surrounds; 3.) locate monsters and
do battle with them thus earning fortune and fame; 4.) return to rearm
and reequip yourself and to report your feats of heroicism.
 
The other periodicals lying about here detail much of the information that
you eventually want to know.  For now, type HELP to see a list of most of
the commands available to you.  HELP <command> to get particular info
about a specific command.  HELP <class> to get help on the different 
classes (be sure to do this on the one(s) you've chosen).  PRACTICE
<class> to see a list of the skills available to you. SCORE to learn a
little about your person.  INVENTORY and EQUIPMENT to see what you have.
WIMPY so that you will flee rather then fight to the death if the battle
goes poorly for you.  Read the NEWS as it details many changes not 
detailed herein.
 
Be sure to SAVE often and RENT at the reception when you are done.
~
E
handout you~
The easiest way to find out about yourself is to type SCORE.  This will
show you quite a bit of general information about yourself, including:
current and maximum hit points, mana and movement; alignment - that is
your inclination toward goodness/evilness; experience points gained and
levels achieved.
 
Eventually you can utilize the ATTRIBUTE command which shows you a lot
more detail.  Armor class, your specific stats (str, dex, int, wis, con),
to hit and to dam bonuses, spells affecting you and degree of hunger and
thirst.
 
For interesting trivia you might also cast a scroll of identify upon
yourself or another...
~
E
treatise leveling practices~
In time, you will have done battle and defeated enough monsters that your
experience will allow you to gain a new level.  SCORE will show you your
present xp as well as your present level.  LEVEL <class> details the
amount needed by each class to level.
 
When the time comes to advance to a higher level, go to your guildmaster
and GAIN.  (HELP GAIN)(HELP XP)  At this point you will advance to the
new level, gain hit points and mana as appropriate and you will be
granted more practice sessions and the skills available to your new 
level.  Also at your guildmaster, you should PRACTICE to see what
skills/spells are known to you.  HELP <skill> to choose what is worth
learning and PRACTICE <skill> once your mind is made up.  It may
require more than one session to fully learn a skill, but items exist
to increase your number of practices and to shorten the time it takes
to learn a skill...
 
Not everything can be learned from the guildmasters close to town.
You will most assuredly want to forage about and look for master's in
other, more remote areas.  For this is where you will learn the most
advanced skills and things not taught by anyone else...
~
E
hints1~
Carry a scroll of recall at all times.  If the battle goes poorly, RECITE
RECALL and get yourself to a place where you can rest up and gather help
before returning to the fray.
 
Carry sufficient supplies for the adventure at hand.  Food and water is
a must as well as a container to hold a large enough supply for 
extended journeys.  For the more advanced, healing elixirs and potions
should be brought along and QUAFF'd when appropriate.
 
Literally in the dark?  Find a place that sells light sources (torches,
lanterns) and HOLD them when you need more illumination.  Realize that
such sources are limited and burn out.  Find a permanent light source
as soon as possible.
 
Can't get to where you want to be?  Some areas require either a boat,
gills or wings to journey in.  The more rugged areas take their toll
on your movement allowance.  Finding spells or items that eliminate
this problem is another important task.
 
Always look around for a group to join with.  Interaction with other
players is half the fun of playing.  It also simplifies killing many
monsters you might not be able to handle alone.
 
When you have defeated a monster, LOOK IN CORPSE/PILE to see what
booty you have won.  GET <item>/ALL CORPSE to loot it.  Killed more
then one creature?  GET ALL 2.corpse, 3.corpse...  should help you
get rich quick.
 
~
E
hints2~
SAVE whenever you have achieved something good or completed a 
monumental task.  Reimbursement is generally given (HELP REIMBURSE),
but in the event of a crash it is your duty to have saved prior to it.
At the end of your session, RENT at the receptionist.
 
If in trouble, be not afraid to ask for help.  Every player has at one
point found themselves in a tight spot and most will be willing to lend
a hand if they are able.  No one wants to do your work for you, but
most will lend assistance to keep you self-sufficient.  Be polite,
don't be pushy.  Remember what killed you, if such is the case, to aid
in corpse retrieval.  Return the favor if someone asks you for help at
a later date.
~
E
leaflet death avoid~
A two-part series.  leaflet1 details ways to avoid dying.  leaflet2 is
on death itself.
~
E
leaflet1~
The simplest and easiest way to avoid dying is to never involve yourself
in a fight.  This is not a long-term practical solution if you also 
expect to level.  At some point, fighting becomes necessary.
 
If the battle goes sour, FLEE'ing is always an option provided you are
able to (conscious, standing) and that an exit exists from the melee.
Having WIMPY set to true will cause you to flee at some fixed percentage
of your max hp's so you need not worry about it too much.  FLEE'ing is
an ignoble retreat from the field of battle and, as such, is penalized
by causing some xp loss dependant on your level.
 
If fleeing is not an option or you choose not to, you may also RECITE
RECALL and magically relocate yourself out of the fight.  It is 
usually wise to rest and get another recall before returning to the
fight.
 
One should not overlook the proper use of certain spells as a means to
ward off death.  Ones of the healing variety and sanctuary decrease
your risk of death dramatically if properly used.  Many can be cast in
battle and it is a good spell caster who knows how and when to use his
spells.  For the thaumatergically-handicapped, potions exist to help
you and can be QUAFF'd.  A battle is a rough climate and potions may
break if you try to imbibe them during the fray.
 
Lastly, only the most foolhardy fights unprepared.  Be as well equipped
as you can, engage whatever protective spells prior to the fight, and
check to be sure you're good condition physically and mentally before
the fray.  Rest/sleep when you need to regenerate some.

Ultimately however, all but the most conservative or lucky of adventurer's
finds himself to be compromised by a monster.  A character with 0 hp's
is stunned but will slowly heal if left alone.  A player with -1 to -10
hp's is considered to be unconscious and dying.  If another player does
not come to his aid quickly, he will slowly die.  If the character goes
below -10 hp's, he is dead, and only the greatest of magics can alter that,
and even that has consequences...  Most mosters will not stop fighting you
until either you or they are dead.  Choose your battles carefully.
 
Death, however, is not "permanent".  You may reenter the game at the
Temple of Midgaard.  You will have 1 hp and be missing all of your
equipment and gold.  Your equipment and gold is within your corpse which
you left behind at the scene of the battle.  You should go and fetch your
belongings (remember to SAVE once it is in your possession).  Monsters
that were angry at you will have forgotten you if you died (Aggressives
are still aggro, however).  Too, you will find that your xp has been 
decreased by half up to a maximum of 2 million xp.
 
Death is of course an annoyance and not something to be sought.  It is
possible to recover from it.  
 
Also, and most importantly, this is after all, only a game.   :)

Batopr's Secret Cave~
You have entered a dark and forebodding cave.  Strange noises come at you
from all directions, your voice echos off many distant objects.  A sense of
dread overwhelms you.  Then you notice the video game parlor carefully hidden
behind a copse of stalagtites.  On closer examination, the endless drop off
with wisps of steam arising from it you first thought stood right before you
turns out to be a jacuzzi with it's lights off giving the water that bottomless
sensation.

  Shadows play tricks on your eyes as you survey the grizzly scene about you.
Body parts in various states of decay lie haphazerdly in the ledges dug into the
dirt walls.  The stench of death is overwhelming.  You cannot help but notice
that someone has been dining on these remains recently.  Rungs in the north wall
lead up to a grating above you.  To the east, cobwebs hang from a dark, stone
archway.
