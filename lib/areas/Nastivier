Nastivier's Crypt ~
     This is a very large ancient crypt including an iron bound, wooden 
coffin resting atop a cold stone altar.  Blood-red candles adrip with molten
wax flicker and fight in an unfelt breeze in the still air.  Shadows dance
and flee from the changing light, rushing to hide in the ever changing shelter
producing erie manifestations from some nether dimension.  Any sound in the
death still air is warped into hideous renditions of their origins.  The 
dead watch the living with the hatred of those that have known life and now
fight to remove it.

A large fissure~
The ground opens up into a very large fissure that goes deeper than the
eye can follow into the earth.  The rock is charred black by whatever
holocost tore the ground asunder creating the fissure.  The sides look
like one could possibly climb down, but at considerable risk to their health.

Deep within the fissure~
Deep within the fissure's black embrace, the hand holds allowing one to
climb become more sparse and treacherous.  Black soot makes the walls
slippery while some of the fragments crumble to dust at the touch of a hand.
Light from far above seems to be almost eaten by the blackness.  An erie feeling
ebbs from the walls, wounded like a hurt animal, cringing from the sightest
touch.

A hidden cavern~
A hidden cavern possibly made by moving hot lava while the fissure was
being formed.  The floor is very uneven, with intricate dips and minor
crevasses threatening to engulf an ankle.  A musty smell rests heavily in
the air, and there are many bones on the floor picked clean, a harsh white
against the ever encompassing blackness.

At the bottom of the fissure~
The bottom of the fissure is covered in bones, both big and small, from 
entities that did not survive the climb down its treacherous walls.  The
light above is almost non-existant, having been engulfed by the dark.  The
air is dead still, and warmer than expected.  It is possible to climb back
up the charred walls, and there is a tunnel leading off to the south.

Dark tunnel~
This is a long blackened tunnel, dark as midnight.  The uneven floor 
makes it difficult to walk quickly.  The air here is still, warm, and thick.
To the north a very faint light can be seen, while the tunnel leads off 
into the darkness south.

Before the castle~
The tunnel opens up to an empty black plain.  There is just enough light
from a uniform sickly grey sky to see by.   Off to the south a grotesquely
shaped triangular castle is the only discernable feature of this barren land.

Enterance of the castle~
The enterance to this obscure castle follows suit with what has come
before, with a large grey oval opening leading out to a grey-black plain.
A strange hue of what passes for light, barely illuminates the large room.  
The air is still and dank, smelling faintly of musk.  A triangular archway
hides more of the castle to the south.

Main Hall~
This is what appears to be the main hall of the castle.  The high walls
converge to a point far above.  Small creatures flitter about at its heights,
making only barely audible sounds.  Small globes on the wall of a lighter
hue of grey appear to be the source of illumination of this large room.  
Triangular archways lead off to the north, south, east, and west.

Here, a north south triangular shaped grey-black hallway intersects with a

a vaguely pink hue light, instead of the more usual grey light.  The hallway 
continues both north and south, while another hallway leads off to the west.
To the east, a large oval door made from the same grey-black substance as 
the walls entices a second look.
