The Studio~
     Around you lies miles and miles of graph paper, a few
trees worth of pencils and only a few finished drawings.

On the Muddy Path~

    Looking east, you see miles and miles of bogs bubbling and oozing 
away.  The path continues north, and there is a huge tree to your east.

In the Grove of Aspens~

    Before you stands a trio of huge aspen, each tree covering nearly
an acre beneath it's branches.   As you wonder how these beautiful trees got here, you sight a young
maiden carving a staff at the base of one fo the trees.   As you approach the young girl, the whole scene
changes from one of serenity and beauty to one of death
and blight.   An Ambush!

Pathway out of the swamp~

     Although unbelievable at first, you have spotted your first
piece of solid ground in this cursed swamp.  As you look north a

    As you travel up the twisting path, you realize that people
have travelled here recently.  Large ruts and divots
lie here in the mud, evidence of large carts and horses, heavily
laden with supplies.  The path continues north up the hill.

Along the edge of the swamp~

    Looking east, you spot the vast wasteland known as the Cursed Swamp 
of Lankhmar.  Few who have trudged through it's waters have escaped with
thier hides intact.  Many a tale tells about this land's once fertile
land and the castle that protected it.  Castle Lankhmar!

Up the stone path~

    Unlike the mires below, this ground seems stable and firm.
Paved with small stone, this path could be a road to a major encampment.
At the top of the hill to the northeast, you spot campfire smoke

one here.  As you look ahead, you see a small stone wall rise up out
of the ground.  Atop the wall, you spy lookout guards looking through
spyglasses on the terrain below.  Ducking behind cover, you wonder
where to turn to next.

sit in positions on the wall, awaiting the next "visitors" to thier

troop movement are evident, as paths from the south and north
travel east to the swamp below.  North you see a large encampment
and south you see a large cliff face.

Kitchen~

    As you walk in, you smill the horrid odor of what can only be large
scale cooking. Dozens of cauldrons, pots, pans, and buckets
boil over flames that do not seem entirely real.  As you look into
one of the buckets, a large man comes out of the larder screaming
"Stay outta my food, vagrants!", and attacks!

Larder~

    Hung above you in long rows, are dozens of skinned and salted

Chieftain's room~

    This room is covered in banners, flags, and symbols of the Wyvern.
Large chests occupy one corner, while a small cot lies in the other.
At center, battlefield lieutenants draw out troop movements on maps, 
while a large man overlooks the plans.  Noticing your entry, the man
throws the oaken table aside and curses at you in some unintelligable tongue.

The Vault~

    Here are the remains of the burial vault of Lankhmar.  The coffin
lid, now in pieces, appears to have been blasted off of the coffin.  The
walls are covered in the conquests and treasures posessed by the great
Anti-Paladin.  Before you have time to read all of the inscriptions,
two knights call your attention.

Lankhmar's Crypt~

    As you enter the small chamber, light escapes from four small 
braziers, one standing in each corner.  Shadowy outlines cover a
large slab of obsidian and large mahogany chest.  Rats scurry in
the crypt door, and look for crevices in the wall, trying to escape
something.  Mystified by the heavy feeling of fear and evil, you
look around only to find the whole room covered in arcane runes
and pictograms.  Held in suspense for an eternity, you hear a sharp
metallic sound behind you.  Whirling around, you see the remains
of the most powerful Anti-Paladin known to man... The Revenant of Lankhmar!

    Looking around, all you see for miles is muck and cypress trees.

Hopelessly Lost in the Swamp~

    Looking around, you now only see muck.  Everything looks familiar
and even the trees seem to laugh at you.  You see a small rise in the
ground to the north.

Nearing the Edge~

    Looking around, you seem more trees and the water is getting shallower.
Looking north, you see a small rock outcropping.  Maybe a chance to 
get out of this muck, after all.

Wine Cellar~

    Around you, piled ten feet high are wooden kegs of ale.  You begin
to wonder if this camp is full of barbarians, or if it is a resort for
mercenaries.
