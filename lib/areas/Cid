Steps to the Senate~
You are at the foot of the steps leading up to the senate building.
Couriers and other officials are in constant motion here, carrying out
the affairs of the empire.  A large fountain is here, in the image of
the god Bacchus, with water spurting from an upraised wine cup.

The Main Hall of the Senate~
This grandiose hall is of immense proportions.  Huge marble pillars
support a roof that seems miles above you.  Everything appears to be
constructed of marble, the floor, benches, and the many statues
of famous Romans.  You are drawn to a magnificent painting of a general
astride a fearsome charger with toes for hooves.  Other notable 
features of this hall are the handsome tapestrys adorning the eastern wall
and the intricately carved wooden doors to the west leading to the senate
chambers.

This painting depicts Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon river during his march
on Rome to seize the dictatorship.  In gold foil is a verse of a prophecy:

A hundred years of the Punic Curse
And Rome will be slave to a hairy man,
A hairy man that is scant of hair,
Every man's woman and every woman's man.
The steed that he rides shall have toes for hooves.
He shall die at the hands of his son, no son,
And not on the field of war.

This picture depicts Tiberius as a general at the head of a legion attacking
a force of Germans on the eastern frontier.  In gold foil is a verse from a
prophecy.

The hairy third to enslave the State
Shall be son, no son, of this hairy last.
He shall be mud well mixed with blood,
A hairy man that is scant of hair.
He shall give Rome victories and defeat
And die to the gain of his son, no son--
A pillow shall be his sword.

This painting depicts Augustus during the princely ceremony at which he
is crowned the first emperor of Rome.  In gold foil is a verse from a
prophecy.

The hairy one next to enslave the State
Shall be son, no son, of this hairy last.
He shall have hair in a generous mop.
He shall give Rome marble in place of clay
And fetter her fast with unseen chains,
And shall die at the hand of his wife, no wife, 
To the gain of his son, no son.

The hairy fourth to enslave the State
Shall be son, no son, of this hairy last.
A hairy man that is scant of hair,
He shall give Rome poisons and blasphemies
And die from the kick of his aged horse
That carried him as a child.
