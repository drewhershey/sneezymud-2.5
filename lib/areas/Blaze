Near a small pond~

You found the secret passage out!  Lucky you.  You can see a glistening pond
to the south.

You may re-enter the catacombs to the north or go for a swim to the south.

On the edge of a small pond~

What a pretty pond.  The sun is glistening off the water..the birds are

There is a distortion field past the water...You might be able to go home.

You may go north or swim toward the distortion field to the west.

A temporal distortion~

You enter a rift in time and space.  You feel like passing out...but that
would not be cool.

You can dive back into the water west or finish your journey to the west.

You are floating and can just make out the Temple of Midguard.  The portal

You can only go down.

Blaze's study~
A blazing fire roars in the red-bricked fireplace.  The glow lights this
dimly lit room.  Along the wall is a massive bookshelf with hundreds of books.
A large armchair rests near the fireplace...it looks soft and cozy.  A sign
on the wall says be nice here or die.
