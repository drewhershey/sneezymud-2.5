The rumors are true!  SneezyMud 3.0 is currently under development.  All new 
areas/mobs/objects/quests are there.  We currently plan on bringing it up near 
the end of October.  There are many new features, with most of the features 
coming from the comments we have received over the last several months.

If you have any questions regarding sneezyMUD 3.0, send me(Brutius)
mail and Ill be glad to talk with you about any questions or ideas you have.
