sign~
Hail, Monk!
You stand at the entryway to the inner circle where all monks must come to 
seek the higher learning of our art.  Within you will meet a monk of
equivalent learning and experience.  In order to gain, you must defeat him.
You will have to fight him entirely naked.  Do not attempt to bring any
equipment in with you, as the masters will surely confiscate and destroy
it.  Because the monk way is a physical one, spells are also frowned upon,
and the masters will remove any magic they find within your body as you
enter.  Victory is achieved by forcing your opponent to flee, failure is
fleeing forst yourself.  Should you flee, you will be deemed unworthy of
the next level, and will lose a portion of your experience.  When you
are prepared, NOD and you will enter the proving grounds.
                  MAY GOOD KARMA BE YOURS!

This oddly colored book was obviously written by a druid (that probably would
explain the color) and dicusses various trees and such that live in the forest.
One thing that does catch your eye is a chapter about telling which trees are
able to cast spells. Apparently, Eucalyptus trees and the trees that "shiver"
do not cast spells, but the trees that "moan" do.

nobody knows what started the fighting (not even they remember anymore), some
historians believe it has something to do with the death of a Roo princess and
an Aborigine prince.

                   NOTICE TO ALL SKEXIE QUESTERS
                 ---------------------------------

You MUST read the rules posted in the Skexie Challenge Instructions Room
located to the north of here and west of the first intersection.  Adherence
to these rules is absolutely essential; failure to do so may be punishable
by loss of all skexie prizes and the revokation of priviledge to continue
to do the future challenges.

"No help may be received while doing the challenges" is interprutted as NO
HELP of any sort (period).  Asking the answer to one of the questions of
knowledge, having a friend help you kill a monster, or using another character
to provide useful spells at appropriate times is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.

A given player may only have ONE prize from each of the three challenges.  If
they are dissatisfied with their current prize, they may junk that prize and
redo the challenge.  You may only be awarded for a prize of the appropriate
level and multi-class characters are assumed to be at the highest of their
classes.  Finally, this is a quest; awards from here are non-reimbursable
under any conditions.

north of here are no longer under my jurisdiction.  Citizens of the Shire are 
encouraged NOT TO ENTER.  Bishop Seklor and his Cult of Undead prefer to be 
left entirely alone, and with the massacre of the garrison at the Shiriff Post 
of the Northern Shire we are not able to provide adequate protection.  
              VENTURING FURTHER IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
