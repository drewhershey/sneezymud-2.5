Stud's little shack.
The smell of two week old pizza and beer is unmistakable as you walk up the
loose steps into a little broken down shack.  After shoving the empty dominoes
boxes out of the way and dodging a few puddles you manage to reach the center
of the room.  From hear you can clearly see a pair of flip-flops over in
the corner next to a yellowish cot.  Just barely poking out of the sheets you
think you see a magazine but think twice about looking at the cover.  Hanging
from the ceiling in the center of the room is a lone light bulb suspended

and all sorts of posters of Led Zeppelin and other bands. There reads 
a sign on the wall that reads "Vengence's Sanctuary".
