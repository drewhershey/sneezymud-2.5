   Houses allow the character who owns it to rent for free.  The character
enters the house, and types rent,and all the stuff is stored.  No one else can
rent in that room, just the owner.  Multi-room houses are legal.  Note:
  No 'gates' will be allowed, the house must be geographically correct.
(i.e. all entrances and exits must be close to each other).

  As a reward for godhood, Players who make godhood will be able to 
purchase houses at a fixed rate (if they so desire) instead of the auction 
price.
