POLYMORPH

Useage      : cast 'polymorph' <target>
Accumulative: No.
Duration    : Permanent until you RETURN.

Polymorph will change your form into that of the target type chosen.  The
advantage of polymorphing is that most monsters will NOT attack things that
look like other monsters.  A polymorphed mage can thus walk around and be 
largely unmolested provided the mage does nothing aggressive.
If you switch into a humanoid monster, you can cast spells if you are a
magic-user or cleric, and you can steal if you are a thief.  To revert back
to your regular form, type RETURN.

Caveat: Because of the nature of Sneezy-Code, should a reboot or crash occur
while polymorphed, there is a good chance that the equipment on the polymorph
will be lost.  You've been warned, so don't ask for reimbursement.
