BRIEF

Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you do not see the
descriptions of the room you are in; only the name of the room, and
the people and objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with the
area in which you travel, however, it is not advisable to use this
command. Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the
descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your surroundings could
mean the difference between life and death!
