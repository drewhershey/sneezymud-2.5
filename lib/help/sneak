SNEAK

Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone taking
notice).  When you type sneak, there is no way to know if you actually
sneak. If you successfully sneak, then you will continue to sneak for
a little while. When you are sneaking, many monsters that would
otherwise attack you will not notice you, allowing you to go places
that no others can get to.
Ex: sneak


Dexterity always has, and still does play a BIG role in whether
or not your sneak is successful. A very bad dex (<10) will most
probably result in the total inability to sneak. These type dex's
have minuses up to -60 to sneak. This is nothing new. It has always
been this way.
