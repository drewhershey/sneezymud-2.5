DOUBLE ATTACK

    Double attack is now attainable by warriors, rangers, thieves, paladins
and antipaladins. The following chart shows the maximum amount that each class
can learn the skill, and the minimum level that they really have a good chance
to hit twice a round.

   Class              Max            Level
   -----              ---            -----
  1) Warrior          90%            6th
  2) Paladin          75%            10th
  3) Ranger           60%            10th
  4) Thief            50%            12th
  5) Anti-Paladin     40%            12th

In addition, your double attack skill is directly related to your triple attack
percentage.
