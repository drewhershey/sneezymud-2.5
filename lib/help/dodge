DODGE
 
        dodge allows fighters and monks to avoid damage in combat.  not 
        a lot -- 1-3 points, but every little bit helps.  Each time you
        are hit, the game checks your dodge skill, which does not improve
        with use, only with practice.  if you make it, the damage is 
        reduced by 1-3 points.. note- this applies to physical attacks
        only.
