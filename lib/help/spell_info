        see help files on:
ALLSPELL - (a listing of all the spells, at what level various classes get 
            their use and what is the minimum mana charge)
you may also ask for help files on the various spells.  If a help file isn't
available for the spell, ask a fellow player about it and tell a god about the
problem via the BUG command.
