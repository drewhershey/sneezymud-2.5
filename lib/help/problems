PROBLEMS
Here are a list of problems a possible solutions for ansi and vt100 screens.

1)  Status bar shows 2's instead of the ansi bar it is supposed to.
  Solution:
	      Either your screen and or terminal can't handle ansi emulation
              or it isnt set to ansi. Only ansi screens set to ansi emulation
              can read the status bar graphs. Make sure your terminal is set to 
              ansi, and that your monitor can handle ansi emulation. If you
              continue to get 2's, switch terminal types on the mud to vt100
              which has no bar graphs.

2)  Status bar rolls with rest of screen.
  Solution :
   1) Make sure you have your screen size entered correctly. The status bar
      works off of your screen size that you enter when you login. If you
      enter a screensize larger than your actual monitor size, you will
      have problems.
   2) For screens larger than 48 rows, try using 48 instead of anything >
      48.

3)  Somehow your status line gets messed up.
  Solution :

        Use the cls command to clear the screen and clear up any
          problems with your status bar.
