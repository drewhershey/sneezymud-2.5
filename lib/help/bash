BASH
Fighters only.

  The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned. To bash
someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you
will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear.
The victim will be unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of
violence. If you miss you loose your balance and fall.
  A bash makes you unable to type commands for 2 rounds of violence.
Note that hitting a person who is resting/sitting will inflict
1.5*damage.
