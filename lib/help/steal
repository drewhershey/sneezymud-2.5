STEAL
Thief Only.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not
getting caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if
the person is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires at least 1,250 XP
points to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters
at all levels.
Ex: steal gold brutius
Ex: steal sword mercenary
