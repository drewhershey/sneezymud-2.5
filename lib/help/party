Would anyone be interested in traveling to an end of the summer
MUD party? It would be held in the twin cities(Minneapolis/St Paul) MN
and is just in the beginning planning stages. If we can get enough people
who want to travel and come to the party, we will have one. I think it
would be very cool to get to meet all the people. Obviously the farther away
you are, the harder itll be to come, but we are trying to get some idea
of who would be interested. If noone wants to do it, we wont waste out
time holding it. Right now the plans would be to hold it in a suite in 
the Hilton.

Mail me if you are interested please, my email address is in the
wizlist.
