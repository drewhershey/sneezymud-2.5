   Killing of newbies (characters up to 5th level, and the first belonging to 
that character) is ABSOLUTELY forbidden.  

   Killing of experienced players, while not specifically forbidden, is 
frowned upon, and if a player becomes a problem, he or she can be penalized, 
barred from the game, or deleted.  Also, since the decisions of 59rd levellers
is final, the actions taken by gods after a player killing can be somewhat 
unpredictable.
