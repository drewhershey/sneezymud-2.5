HEADBUTT

Headbutt is a level 15 warrior skill.  While you are able to practice it before
15th level, you will be unable to use it until then.  Headbutting your opponent
does a hefty amount of damage in combat but has the drawback of pausing
you for 6 combat rounds.  Success depends on how well the skill is learned
with some adjustments for dexterity of the aggressor.  Damage due to headbutt
equals one point per level and one point per point of strength.
