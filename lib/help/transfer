  This wizard command moves a character into the same room with the
wizard.  You can also transfer monsters with this command, but be
careful when using this command near aggressive monsters.  Getting a
player killed is NOT good form.

  trans 4.lamia            (this monster is aggressive, watch it)
  at 2 trans PlayerKiller  (send this person to Hell.  On Sneezy mud
                            there is no way to walk out of Hell)
