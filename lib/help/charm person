Is is not possible to charm anyone that is already charmed, if you are
charmed yourself, or if the person is higher level than yourself. The
person will get a saving throw versus "paralysation".

A charmed person will follow you, and not be able to attack you, you
can order charmed person using the order command.  The master of a charmed
creature is responsible for its actions.  Make sure your pets do nothing
