The metaphysician is a neat little character. He will soon be with us here
at Sneezy. He is basically for all you players who either :
A) already have an immortal. or
B) don't wanan play an immortal.

You will be able to trade in a certain amount of exp for some neat things.

1) one point added to any stat(except con).
2) some amount (yet to be determined) of extra hp or mana points.
3) No more hunger or thirst.
