WHERE

Tells you the location of a monster, a player or an object. Examples:
where torch
where dragon
where 4.ring       (gives you the container traceback so you can find
                    out WHO has that One Ring)

Mortals can only "where" monsters or players, and only from their own
zone.

Immortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where everybody is.
