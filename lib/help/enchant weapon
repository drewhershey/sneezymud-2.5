This spell will enchant non-magical (non-modifying) weapons only.  By
non-modifying weapons we refer to weapons that might alter any ability
such as for example damage. The only way to know if a weapon is
suitable for enchantment is to fully identify it.

The enchantment will modify the weapon as:
Level    Hit Roll    Damage

 0..17     +1         +1
18..19     +2         +1
20+        +2         +2
