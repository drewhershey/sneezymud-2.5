Praying is currently used only by ghosts who have died and are trying
to escape back into the plane of mortals.

Praying has 4 options. 

1) Pray to a god for an item sacrifice in return for being placed 
    back in the realm of mortals. If the god turns down your item
    sacrifice, you must choose one of the other three options. 

2) Praying with option two, will send you back to the mortal plane,
    and cost you 1/3 of your exp.(No maximum)

3) Praying with this option will send you back to the mortal plane,
    at the cost of 200000 coins/level.

4) Praying with this option will result in the loss of three random
    stat points(non -19 of course).  With the meta physician , this
    pretty much ends up as losing 3 million exp.

Sidenote : Quitting as a ghost accomplishes the same thing as praying with
             option 3.
