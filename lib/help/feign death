FEIGN DEATH
Monk Only.

Allows a monk to pretend they have died.  The people/things that are
attacking you will stop fighting you, and may leave you alone completely,
although it is best to leave the room as soon as possible.  The attempt
will set the monk sleeping.  Success means you merely need wake and make
your exit, while failure allows the mob to get a free round in while the
monk suffers from being prone (incurs extra damage).
