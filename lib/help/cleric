CLERIC

  This class gives you the wisdom of peace, blessing and healing,
though it is possible to learn more violent spells.  You can improve
your spells by using the practice command.

Clerics initially gain at the guild which is north, west from the fountain
at market square.  At higher level they must go and find teachers in remote
locations in order to level.
