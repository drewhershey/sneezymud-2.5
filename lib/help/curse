CURSE

Usage       : cast 'curse' (victim | object)
Accumulative: No
Duration    : 7 Days, permanent on objects.

Curse cast on a person that fails the saving throw, will reduce the
hitroll by one, and reduce the saving throw versus paralysation by
one. 

Curse cast on an object will make the object anti-good and prevent it from
being dropped.  It also reduces the damage die on a weapon by 1.  Hence,
a 5d5 weapon becomes a 5d4.
