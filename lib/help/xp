XP

Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.
When enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.  Things
you should know about experience points:

The actual amount of experience points recieved equals the experience
points from the kill divided by the number of classes you are.  Thus,
a triple class recieves 1/3 of the experience from each kill as a
single class would.
