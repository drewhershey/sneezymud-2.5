MAGIC USER

This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user
does not control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such. You
can improve your spells by using the practice command.

The mage's guild in town is located west, west, south of the fountain at
market square.  At higher levels, advanced study can only be sought from
reclusive guildmasters in remote locations.
