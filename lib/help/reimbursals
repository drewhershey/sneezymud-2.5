   The following is the SneezyMUD reimbursal policy as of March 17th, 1993.

   Unlike some other MUDs, SneezyMUD will reimburse in situations caused by
faulty coding and/or a failure in the mud.  A small list of when you can and
can't ask for reimbursment follows.

When you can ask for reimbursal :

1) Total equipment loss due to rent failure. 

    This doesn't happen often, if ever. This type of request will be
    checked into before reimbursal is given.

Thats really about it.

When you shouldn't ask for reimbursal :

1) Any problems with linkdeath : Linkdeath, and other link and net related 
       problems are not cause for reimbursal.

2) The "I think one item has disappeared syndrome" :
      If you seem to be missing one item, or hink that is the case, go get it
      again. If you got it once you can go get it again.

3) At NO time will any gold and/or coi nage EVER be reimbursed.

4) Exp reimbursals will have to be ok'ed by a level 59 god or higher. the
     same rules apply to exp as to all other reimbursal procedures.

5) As this reimbursal policy is being written, the monster structure on 
     SneezyMUD is slowly changing from one of "make a monster that can
     kill you in three hits" to one of, "make a monster that can outsmart
     a player". There will be monsters in the game that are item hunters
     and/or reposession monsters. If you lose any item to these monsters
     it is of course non-reimbursabal. Monsters are being lessened in power
     and greatened in Wit and intelligence. This should make for a much more
     interesting game, and much less of the item hogging, I am better than you
     type of game-attitude.



Any situations not covered in this, are open to litigation on a personal
basis. These are the rules, they are hopefully clear and fair. Reimbursal
is a headache for players and Gods. Lets try to keep it to a minimum.
