FLAG

This command will set/unset a given player as killer/outlaw/banished.  A
player may obtain killer/outlaw flags by his actions in the world.  Attacking
a fellow non-killer PC will give the attacker killer flag.  Stealing from
non-outlaw PC will yield outlaw status for the thief.  Death removes these two
flags naturally.  If the god chooses and reason warrents, he may use this 
command to flag a person or deflag a person appropriately.  Such a flagged
person will be unable to rent from Midgaard, and may have a tough time
interacting with "law abiding" citizens around the world.

Banished can only be set by a god.  A banished player will automatically
enter the game at 2 (Hell) where there should eb a tormentor waiting.  Setting
this flag on any player over 10th level requires approval of a 56th god.
Low level players who appear to merely be playing for the sake of causing
mischief (harrassment/spamming) should be banished.

syntax: FLAG [player name] [flag type]

For cases where you are "pardoning" someone: a value of 10K per level should be
set.  Note, triple class 10/10/12 would have to pay 320K (10+10+12)*10 to
get pardoned.  This is probably a lot, but then again, they screwed up.
