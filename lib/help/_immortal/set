@SET
 
   Allows a high-level god to manipulate a pc or mobs stats.  Indiscriminate
   use of this where mortals are concerned is a good way to get demoted.
   @set <field> <name> <value> <value2>
 
   <name> is the name of the PC/MOB being @set
   The following are valid <fields>:
	align		str		int		wis
	dex		con		gold		bank
	exp		ac		hit		mana
	tohit		todam		hunger		thirst
	prac
   These are also valid but need explanation:
	class	:bitvector(1=mu, 2=cl, 4=wa, 8=th, 16=pa, 32=an, 64=mo, 128=ra)
	lev     :needs 2 parameters. 1st is level value, 2nd is class (0,1,2,3) 
	race	:uses numerical values from race.h
	age	:the amount of years to add or subtract.
	mhit	:maximum hp
	sex	:0=3=neutral, 1=4=male, 2=5=female
	add or stadd	: the /xx values for strength bonus
   These are defined, but not sure what they do:
	board (???)	saves (sets 1st saveing throw only)
	skills (2 params?  1st is skill # from from spells.h. 2nd is always 0?)
	  -recommend you @set pracs and load a guildmaster.
