STRING

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (objs) and actions (chars))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For objs, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for objs. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make
you enter a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to
the string until you exceed the maximum length for the string or you
end a line with a '@'.
