SILENCE

If the game is lagging badly, use this command to prevent characters from
shouting.  Do not use this to eliminate conversation (gossip) going on
via shout as opposed to radio.  In those situations, use noshout (player)
or just noshout yourself.

Note: if you seek the help on silence spell.  switch into a low level
mob and type help silence.
