SLAY
 
   Instantly causes the arguement of this command to have -10 hitpoints and be
   killed.  Useful for destroying a mob or player without the hassle of 
   fighting it.  Things slain will yield a corpse complete with equipment and
   gold, but will yield no xp to the slayer nor will PC's lose any xp by
   being slain.
