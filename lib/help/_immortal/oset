OSET

Oset is the command that allows you to modify the attributes of any object
in the game world.  WARNING:  indiscriminate use of this command in ANY
non-Brut-approved way is good way to get demoted.  Use your best judgement,
but remember that you may very well be demoted if you start oset'ing peoples
equipment.

Oset has a wonderful on-line help facility.  Just use:

oset <name> 

where <name> is the name of the object, to get a bunch of fields that
you can further manipulate.
