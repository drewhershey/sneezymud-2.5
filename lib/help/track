TRACK

   This skill allows the user to attempt to find a path leading from where
   you currently are to where the person or mob named as the qualifier of
   the command is located.  Track is inhibited by certain terrain types, and
   other discontinuities (teleport rooms, etc).  There is also a limit to how
   far away something may be located to successfully track it.
