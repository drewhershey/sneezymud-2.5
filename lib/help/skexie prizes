You should now be hard pressed to find better equipment then this anywhere in 
the game.  In accordance, the challenge difficulty has been raised.

Special Note: SNEEZYmud never applies grandfather clauses for upgrades and
changes.  This means that when we make an item worse, we will not force
everyone to change to new stats.  However, it works both ways.  NO YOU MAY
NOT TRADE IN YOUR OLD PRIZE FOR A NEW ONE.  You may however, junk your
old prize, redo the challenge according to the rules, and be awarded 
appropriately if of the correct level.

Direct questions or gripes to the Lord of Worlds (Batopr).
