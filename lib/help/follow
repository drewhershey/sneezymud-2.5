FOLLOW

  If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why
not simply follow that person? For example: "Follow joe". If you are
following someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you have
to do is follow yourself: "follow <your name>".
  You will not follow someone if: they move into an area where there is
insufficient room to follow (tunnel), if you become involved in a fight
or take damage (trap) and they move on, or if the leader dies instantly
for his choice of direction (death trap).
