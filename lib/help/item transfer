To prevent  1) Item hoarding, and 2) corpse looting :

The following are now in effect :

1) You cannot get an item that you cant use. I.e. Joeblow who is level
    one can't rob bee's corpse, because he isnt high enuff to get the stuff
    from the corpse in the first place.

2) You cannot give an item to anyone who cant use it. I.e. Level 40 character
    can't give a storage character, or any other character any items that
    is something they arent high enough level to use.

3) You can't rent with an item you cant use. Soon(within the next week)
    all items in rent that are on characters who cant use them will be deleted.
    You have from now until then to either get them transferred, or get the
    character they are on up to the correct level.
