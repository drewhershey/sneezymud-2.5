PALADINS

Paladins are the class that is considered the hardest and most challenging
to play. Since paladins must stay close to god to retain their powers, align-
ment below 350 can be devastating for a paladin. When a paladin is above 350
alignment though, they have not only warrior skills, but healing powers as well.

Paladins can visit their guild hall by going south, west, west, south from the
fountain at market square.
