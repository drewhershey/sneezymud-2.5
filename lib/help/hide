HIDE
Thieves Only.

When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room. If
hidden you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell. Even if
sensed your identity will remain hidden. Hide is broken by pressing
return, regardless of whether you typed a command or not.
Ex: hide
  Ok.
  >  (you wait for ex. 5 mins and remain hidden for 5 mins)

  >  (You pressed enter and no longer hide)
