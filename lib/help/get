GET, TAKE

  If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get'
to pick it up. 

Ex:  	get greatsword		picks up greatsword and adds it to inventory
	get all.bread bag	pulls all the bread out of your bag into inv.
	get 9*bread bag		pulls 9 breads from bag and adds to inv.
	get all corpse		gets everything out of a corpse
	get all			gets everything in the room

Fixed! There is no longer any ambiguity between containers in your
inventory and on the ground.  The ones in your inventory are 1..n and
the ones on the ground are (n+1)..(n+m).

If an item has a level restriction, someone of inadequate level will be
unable to pick it up.
