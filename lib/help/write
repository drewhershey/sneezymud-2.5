WRITE

  In order to write a note, you need a piece of blank paper (or
similar), and a pen of some sort. You can then type something like
"write on the paper with the pen", whereupon you will be asked to type
in your note at the keyboard.
  This command is also used at any of a number of boards around the world
to post notes, information, and other statements for general dissemination.
Please do NOT post other mud addresses to the boards.
  To get in touch with a single person in a more private manner, use mail.
