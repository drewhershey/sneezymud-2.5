GRAPPLE

   Grapple is a level 20 fighter skill. A successful grapple cause the
opponent and you to wrestle on the ground, resulting in a loss of attack
for two rounds. Since monsters with more than one attack are hard to keep
down, they will only be stopped one round. A successful grapple will also 
cause that monster to turn its attention toward the grappler.
