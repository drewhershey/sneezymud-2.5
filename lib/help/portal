PORTAL

Useage      : cast 'portal' <target>
Accumulative: No.
Duration    : 5 hours.

    Portal is a high level mage/cleric spell, that allows a person to make
a portal to a certain mob or player, of which anyone can enter. If the target 
is in a darkened room, a way of seeing in the dark must be used.
    Portals are fixed to their target and to the place from which the spell
was cast.  Should the target die, or move away from where it was when the
portal was created, there is a good likelihood that the portal will take
you to The Void.
