SHOPS

  Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to
survive the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade
only in a specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse
to buy your armor, even if it is of high quality!
  To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The
shopkeepers are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of
trading and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect
is death in the end.  (They usually have a few thousand hitpoints and
can shoot through schools).
