CHANNEL

  The channel command has two functions. Without an argument, by typing channel
you will get a listing of all players whom you can see, and what channel they
are tuned into(granted they are using a radio at all of course).
With an argument, channel can be used to change the channel your radio is on.

ex: CHANNEL 9   (changes your radio to begin monitoring and sending on channel
		9, provided your radio has at least 9 channels)
