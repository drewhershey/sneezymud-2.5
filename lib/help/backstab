BACKSTAB
Thief and antipaladin only.

Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place your dagger in
his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful
backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level:
The multipliers for a single class thief are:
1 - 3 :	 2		13-20 :  5		33-38 :  8
4 - 7 :  3		21-26 :  6		39-44 :  9
8 -12 :  4		27-32 :  7		45-50 : 10
The multipliers for a multi-class thief or an antipaladin are:
1 - 4 :  2		9 -13 :  4
5 - 8 :  3		14-50 :  5

The chance of successfully backstabbing a person depends on how well
you have practiced backstab at your guild.  In order to "backstab" both
your backstab roll and your hit roll must succeed.  (i.e. you can totally fail
to get your blade near your opponent (missed hit) or just plain miss the
backstab (missed backstab roll))
