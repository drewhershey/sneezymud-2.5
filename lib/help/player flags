PLAYER FLAGS

The new player killing/stealing system follows :

Player killing :
   
  1) Any attack on a player will flag you as a PLR_KILLER. (This includes
     any attack spells, wands, staffs, any offensive skills, or just plain
     hitting.)

Player stealing :
 
  1) Any player CAUGHT stealing from a player, will be flagged as PLR_OUTLAW.
     The hospital has been made nosteal. It would probably be of your best
     interest to NOT sleep just anywhere. Sleeping with no thought, will
     probably result in a thief having a new piece of equipment.

Anyone flagged PLR_KILLER or PLR_OUTLAW will be automatically attacked by
all cityguards of Midgaard, and various cityguards of various other towns.
The only way to lose your killer flag or outlaw flag is to die. These flags
DO save through renting/quitting. Accidental attacks will be handled by gods
on an individual basis. Policemen in midgaard, will hunt down outlaws who try 
to enter midgaard. Outlaws and killers can't rent in any town except New Thalos
which is basically the "haven" for outlaws. Of course, killing a criminal will
NOT result in a flag.

A new flag (-k) for the who list will list out all outlaws/killers. I.e.
typing who -k will list all the names of all the killer and outlaws.

Basically this system allows player killing and stealing, but sets very harsh
penaltys for those who decide to do such devious acts.
