  Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player.
This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills
of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class.
However, they lack the ability to use magic of any sort.
  You can improve your skills by using the practice command, in the
room in the swordspeople's guild with the guildmaster (usually the
last room)
