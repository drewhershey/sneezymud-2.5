   A character who kills the mayor in single combat earns the right to 
   be the mayor for 1 realworld week.  (from the day of the fight)

   The fight has to be witnessed by a 54th level god (or higher).

   Player cannot flee from combat.  Flight indicates loss, and the player
   cannot try again for 1 real day.

   Mages and clerics can use NPC followers.  No PC assistance (or god)
   will be allowed.

   Once the mayor has been killed, no other fights will be honored for
   the period of one week.. ignorance of the fact that the mayor position
   is still taken is of no consequence.

   The mayor of the week will have her (or his) name placed on the 
   message of the day.  If that person reaches immortality during
   that week, they will be removed from the mayor list, and the position
   will once again be open.

   I am also considering allowing the mayor of the week to call for
   cityguards, but i have not decided.
