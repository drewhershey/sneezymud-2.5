BLESS

Usage       : cast 'bless' <victim or object>
Accumulative: No
Duration    : 6 Hours, permanent for objects.

Bless on a victim will improve the victims saving throw versus spells
by 1, and furthermore improve the hitroll by 1.

Bless on an item currently has no defined action. It is only possible
to bless non-evil items, and the object blessed may weight no more
than five pounds per level of caster. Eventually, there may be
monsters that take extra damage from blessed weapons, so it may be
useful.
