THROW

Throw is a 15th level fighter skill.  Success depends on how well it is
learned.  Throw will attempt to pick a monster up, and hurl him from
the room.  You must also indicate the direction to throw the victim in.
If throw fails, or if there is no exit (closed door, wall) in the chosen
direction, then the target will usually get extremely mad and engage the
thrower.
Ex: throw brutius south
