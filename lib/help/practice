PRACTICE

  Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve (GAIN).  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practise a certain
amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to use this, it
can be accumulated.
