KICK

The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned. The
higher level you reach the harder you kick. There is one small catch -
whenever you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for
three rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee!
One point of damage is done per level.
