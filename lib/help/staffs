Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staves will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, in some cases, or everyone not in your group in others.
Therefore staves are naturally very powerful, and yet may be very
dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either
a character or an object.

Both staves and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.
