FLEE

  If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little
uncomfortable (maybe you are about to die), just type 'flee', and
presto! you are out of harm's way - that is, IF you are still standing
and, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit does not
simply take you out of the frying pan and into the fire... but then,
who wants to live forever?

Beware! It can be more difficult to flee from a high level monster.

Watch out when you flee, you might drop something in your haste to
get out of danger!
