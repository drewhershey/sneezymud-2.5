  NEWS

  This command will show you the current edition of "the DikuMUD
Herald", a publication dedicated to news and useful information about
this world. It is a VERY good idea to check it out once in a while.
NOT checking it out will probably get you dead.
  Important and major policy changes and updates are often stored in help
files and can be indexed after they have passed out of news in the
HELP GENERAL INFO file.
