ANTIPALADINS

  Antipaladins are the class that represents everything that is crude and
evil. Like the paladins, antipaladins must retain a certain alignment to
reain all of their powers. If antipaladins stay below -350 alignment, they
not only have some thief and some warrior skills, but also have some nice
offensive spells.

The antipaladins guild is east, south from the fountain at market square.
