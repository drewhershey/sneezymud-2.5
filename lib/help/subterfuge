SUBTERFUGE

   Subterfuge is a level 10 thief skill. If subterfuge is correctly used,
any NPC that is hunting or has a hatred, will have it removed. 

 ex.  JoeBlow attacks the battle master. Joe has to flee. The battle master
      is now hunting Joe, and wants to kill him. If a thief successfully
      does a subterfuge on the battle master, he will totally forget who
      he is hunting.
