HOUSE

Homes can be purchased from a god for any players comfort.  Advantages of
owning a home include:

-Status symbol - A sneezy mark of distinction.
-A safe place to recuperate.  Wandering monsters will not wander into your
home, nothing can attack you inside the home, nor can monsters summon you
out of your home at will.
-Somewhere else besides the reception to rent.  The owner of a home may cause
a receptionist to appear so that easy entrance and exiting from the game is 
possible.

Cost:  Your basic home, with all of the features listed above lists at 5
million gold coins.  For an added 5 million coins, the house can have a 
magic recuperative spell cast on it which will double the owner's regeneration
of hit points.

All homes only have benefit for their owner.  No joint ownership is allowed.
All homes will appear in the Cherry Hills section of town just south of
Inside the East Gate of Midgaard.  All homes are lockable and keys are
available to the owner from a god.  Extra keys for someone else (no benefits
other then access) are available at 100K gold.

Property Tax:  currently, there is none.  The common council has been
debating charging property owners in order to contribute to the CityGuard
Disability and Retirement fund.
