REIMBURSE

When permissible:
In cases of complete rent failure.  i.e., when you return with absolutely
nothing to the game and it is not due to death.  Such cases MUST be verified
by a god through a log check.

What is not reimbursable:
Coins, money, gold.
Quest prizes.  (including skexie)
Any item you are unable to use. (anti-class, leveled)
Any item that is no longer in existance.  "Old items" are to be replaced
    with "new".  No osetting of objects at all.
Any item "earmarked" as unloadable (thus unreimbursable) by Brutius.
Any item that was not in your possession at the time of a crash/shut down.
    (on a charm, picked up by a scavenger, on the ground)
Experience points: not reimbursable without the OK of a 59+ god.

Situations when NOT to ask for reimbursement:
-"I lost link 'cuz my server/local system went down and must of died".  No
link related deaths or losses are reimbusable.
-"My equalizer seems to be missing.  I know I rented with it."  Chances are
you got zapped by aligned/leveled equipment and didn't notice, fled from
battle and dropped your weapon without noticing, junked/sold/gave away the 
wrong item, attempted to rent with 200+ items and had the excess wiped, or
were robbed by some lucky thief.  Single item reimbursements are strictly
forbidden.  In such cases you are advised to go get the item again, if you
are incapable of this, then you didn't deserve the item in the first place.
