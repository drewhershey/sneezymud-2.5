RADIO

      Radios are the new form of communication. They are held(in a new radio
equipment slot) There will be more than one type of radio, and the costs will
vary with the technology. The most expensive ones will have up to 9 or 10
different channels to choose from, while the cheap ones will have 2 or 3. And
there will be many in-between. The radio shop is in the mall.

   Shout is still in the game for emergencys. Shout may be used ONCE to
tell the mud about a piece of equipment being auctioned.

  i.e. JowBlow shouts 'Longsword for sale...tune in channel 1'

   For group communications we recommend GT (group tell)
