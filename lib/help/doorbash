DOORBASH
 
  Doorbashing is a skill that allows one to open locked doors.  One must
refer to the door by name, not the direction of travel. 
     Success means that the door is unlocked and opened and the attempter is
placed in the room on the other side of the door, while failure causes the 
attempter to be stunned for a short time, and take a fair amount of damage in 
the process.  Not all doors can be doorbashed
Ex: doorbash gate
Ex: doorbash door north
