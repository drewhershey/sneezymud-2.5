  Spying helps a thief character gain information about the world around 
him/her.  After one has typed 'spy', one can look in various directions,
and given that there is an exit in that direction, and nothing blocking
the way (like a closed door), then the contents of the other room will
be displayed.
 
   It also helps when attempting to value an item carried by another 
person.  Usually, it will tell that person that you are looking at a particular
item.. however, if you successfully spy, they won't notice.
