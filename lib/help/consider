CONSIDER

Usage : consider <monster>

This command will initially only provide a comparison of your level versus 
the monster being considered.  This is a VERY ROUGH estimate of the degree of
difficulty.  More information may be obtained by improving your consider 
skills.  A certain person skilled in the ways of monsters around Midgaard
can help with this for a price.
