DEATHSTROKE

    Deathstroke is the most powerful warrior skill. A successful deathstroke
will result in loss of mega damage to the opponent. Unfortunately, deathstroke
is not without its risks. A missed attack at the persons vitals will result
in a long pause, and also will result in the monster getting an attack back at 
YOUR vitals!(fair is fair?) A missed attack will also result in the loss of all
movement points.
