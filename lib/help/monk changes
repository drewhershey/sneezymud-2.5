MONK CHANGES

The monk class has been reworked a bit in order to deal with them from a
more realistic standpoint.

Benefits: Monk bare hand damage has been greatly increased.  The help file
on MONK DAMAGE is updated with the new values.
In addition, with every 5 levels monks attain, they will add +1 to hit.

Detriments: Monk's are now unable to wear any piece of equipment that is
of type: ARMOR.

These are changes and are in addition to the lowering of AC with level and
inability of monks to wear items that are anti-(any other classes)
