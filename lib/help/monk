MONK

The monk is an oriental warrior/thief.  Their monastic vows require them to
live a very simple life, foregoing material wealth and the trappings of
luxury.  In return for being eternally poor and being forbidden to wear armor
of any sort, they are taught the secrets of hand to hand combat.  When a 
candidate has proven himself worthy, the monk masters pit him against a
monk teacher of equivalent combat skill, defeating him is the only way for
the monk to advance.  But advancement has the rewards of devestating bare
hand damage and speed and quickness of attack.  There are also other oriental
secrets of fighting that only a monk is capable of.  The power of the dragon
with the fleetness of the ninja is the monk's way.  A monk's armor class drops
5 points per level (you must rent out to take effect).

Monks must travel to the monk monestary near Took Hill in the Shire in order
to find their guildmaster.  The practice and level commands are tied to the
letter K for monks.  LEVEL K and PRACTICE K will show the respective info.
