New stuff to try and "balance" all the classes.

1) The idea of a complete fighter/healer in one character is ludicrous.
   In no shape form or fashion should one player be able to do >+30
   damage and be wearing a good bit of +mana items at the same time.
   All but a couple of the large +mana items have been change to be -
   to hit and dam. For the true healers this shouldnt hurt because a "true"
   healer never really attacks anyway. For a true fighter it shouldn't hurt
   either, because a "true" fighter wont worry about mana at all. The only folx
   this is gonna hurt are the folx who think they are invincible, and try
   to go around with +40 damage and 500 mana. This will no longer be possible.
   Also, removing an item takes away the affects of the item IMMEDIATELY.
   No more removing +150 worth of mana items and having that "extra" mana for
   a tick. I am hoping this will result in the development of more "true"
   healers and fighters.
2) Some new spells for mages involving components and/or spell books will
    be coming in very soon. Here is an example of one.

   SPELL : Enchant magical

   USAGE : Enchant one magical items.
 
   LEVEL : Level 35 mage.
  
   COST : 1 million exp, 1 "component", 100 mana, 
            and a chance of losing 1 con pt.

   Obviously this isnt a real spell but just a fictitious example.
   Think about its power though....


As usual I am always open to ideas to balance the classes. Mail me either
on the mud or at my email address, if you have an idea which you think will
help class balance.
