MAIL

The SneezyMUD mailing system is compliments of Rasmussen from the now
defunct CircleMUD(and now at JediMUD).

The commands to use in the post office are :

1) Mail <player> (self-explanitory) (costs 500 gp to send mail)
2) Check : checks for mail
3) Receive : gets all mail from postmaster

All these commands only work in the post office. (which is north of the
                                                  adventurers guild).
