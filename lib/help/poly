There is a rather long, and involved list of monsters that you can
choose from, and the list expands as you get higher in level.

the monsters are probably not well balanced right now, you will 
undoubtedly find some that are too strong, or some that are too
weak in comparison to the others in the room

I would be very grateful if you tell me which ones are too strong
and which ones are too weak.

Correct syntax and format for this is:
	
	cast 'polymorph' <creature_type>

where you replace <creatue_type> with one of the creatures listed below.

To return to your character, type the command:  RETURN
If you switch into a humanoid monster, you can cast spells if you are a
	magic-user or cleric, and you can steal if you are a thief.

Now, here is the list:

    name       level of caster 
  {"goblin",      4*
  {"parrot",      4 (blue)
  {"frog",        4
  {"gnoll",       6*
  {"parrot",      6 (black)
  {"lizard",      6
  {"ogre",        8*
  {"parrot",      8 (red)
  {"wolf",        8
  {"spider",      9 
  {"beast",       9 (displacer)
  {"minotaur",    9*
  {"snake",       10 (rattle)
  {"bull",        10
  {"warg",        10
  {"sapling",     12*
  {"ogre-maji",   12*
  {"black",       12 (dragon)
  {"jackalwere",  12*
  {"troll",       14*
  {"crocodile",   14
  {"mindflayer",  14* (junior)
  {"giant",       16* (hill)
  {"shark",       16
  {"blue",        16 (dragon)
  {"enfan",       18* (blue)
  {"lamia",       18*
  {"drider",      18
  {"wyvern",      20
  {"mindflayer",  20*(senior)
  {"spider",      20 (bird)

The ones with * are humanoid.
