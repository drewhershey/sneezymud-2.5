     Aliases are now in.

  Syntax for them is as follows :

  alias <abbreviation> <function> (i.e. alias tg tickle guard) Sets alias.
  alias <abbreviation>            Removes alias.
  alias                           Lists current aliases.


  Aliases WILL be saved when you quit/rent/get caught in crash!
