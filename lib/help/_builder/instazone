INSTAZONE

   For zone-builders but not recommended.  Will create a zone file by typing
   instazone <min vnum> <max vnum>
   and will save the current postitions and states of everything in that zone.
   DO NOT do this except in your own zone EVER.  Not recommended when you
   have mobs that are non-sentinel as they will wander out of position between
   being loaded and instazoning.  (make zonefile off-line, it's easier)
