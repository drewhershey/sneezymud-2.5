BUILDER

Hello, and welcome to immortality.  First things first.  This file is directed 
toward a 51 level player, you are now "immortal" but are not a "god".  Because
you are assisting the mud by area-creation, you have been given a character
with a bit of privledges over the run-of-the-mill mortal.  DO NOT ABUSE THIS!

Things you should know:  
1.) don't have your builder character and any of your mortals on at the same 
time.  It appears as if you are cheating.
2.) Do not imitate a god.  No reading of the Wiz Board.  No handling mortal
complaints.  No responding to cries of "I need a god!"  Immortal does NOT
equal godhood.
3.) Do not use your builder to assist or interact with mortals.  i.e.
editing a "convienient exit" or making a room extra-healing and peaceful or
something is a sure way to lose your builder position.
4.) use common sense about what you learn from your builder position as to
what should be passed on.  Things in the docs are usually considered
"classified" and not for general knowledge.

Need assistance:  The "Lord of Worlds" is your best bet as he is directly
responsible for helping you to finish your zone.  You should also contact
him in order to obtain the most updated copy of the docs.
For quick questions, proofreading, brainstorming and the like almost any
god will do.  Most high level gods have finished an area themselves so can
handle technical questions.  Consultation with players is permitted regarding
what "items are needed".
