RSAVE and RLOAD

   Used by zone builders to save and restore work done on-line to their world
   file.  RLOAD will restore what ever rooms were saved in the last rsave, thus
   you should always save your entire zone when RSAVE'ing even if you only
   alter one room.  Likewise RLOAD your entire zone.  CAUTION: If you have
   work saved in one area, and then go and do work in a second area and rsave
   that second zone, all the work in the original area will be lost.
        format:  rload <minimum virtual room #> <maximum virtual room #>
   You can seriously screw up the game by rsaving/rloading outside of your
   allocated zone- NEVER rsave anything in any part of the world that doesn't
   belong to you.
