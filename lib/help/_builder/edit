   Edit allows you to edit rooms.  The room you are currently in is
the one that is edited.  You can edit any room, but the changes will
not be permanent.  However, using the rsave, and rload commands, you
can save your changes into a file, and reload them later into the
game, (if it crashes, for example).

NOTE: If you are confused by this, and try it anyway, you may crash
    the game.  Please be very sure that you know what you are doing.
    Also, try to avoid making too many changes to the existent areas
    for the moment.

Also note: You need to have an area, before you start editing it. this
does not create rooms, only edits them.  Contact Brutius if you need
an area assigned to you.  Also ask him any questions that you have
about room editing.


The fields work as follows:

 edit <field> <attributes>

   field is one of the following:

	name     :  changes the name of the room.
	desc     :  changes the room description.
	exit     :  adds, deletes or modifies a room's exits
	fs       :  changes the Flags, and Sector type.
	exdsc    :  adds, changes or deletes an exit description
	extra    :  adds an extra description to a room.
	riv      :  adds special parameters for rivers.
	tele     :  makes the room a teleport room.
        tunn     :  makes the room a tunnel room.

   attributes:

	name  <name of room>
	desc  <enter>  (it will prompt you for text)
	exit  <dir> <door flags> <key> <to_room>
	fs    <flags> <sector_type>
	exdsc <dir> <enter>  (prompts you for text)
	extra <keywords> <enter>  (prompts you for text)
	riv   <speed> <dir>
        tele  <time> <to_room> <look-flag>
        tunn  <mob_lim>

<dir>  0 = n, 1 = e, 2 = s, 3 = w, 4 = u, 5= d.
<door flags> 0 = no door. (just exit). 1 = door, 2 = pickproof door.
<key> item # that opens door, (if no door, use -1)
<to_room>  The room # that the exit goes to.
<flags>   type 'help room flags' for info
<sector_type>  type 'help sector types' for info
<time> The time interval between teleports.  Must be a multiple of 10
       10 is very fast.  60 is much slower.  
<look-flag> whether to do a look when the characters are teleported.
            if this number is 0, they won't konw they've been teleported
            unless they look on their own.  if the number is not 0, each 
            time they are teleported, they are forced to look.

<keywords> which things will trigger info.. for example if the keyword is
	case
	then if you type look at case, the text will be displayed.

<speed>  must be a multiple of 15. if you do not want the river to flow, 
	speed should be 0.  

<mob_lim>  A number, indicating the number of mobiles that can be in the
           room at one time.  The TUNNEL roomflag must be set, although
           use of edit tunn X  automatically sets the flag.           

****** NEW TELEPORT STUFF *********

You can now send a message with a teleport. Read below :


Before to make it say : You are suddenly sucked under water.
   You would have to make an intermediate room, name it you are.....
   and then teleport to it, and then to the right room. Now, you
   can send a message with the teleport. For instance :

Room 1 : On the river. (Is a teleport room)
Room 2 : The bottom of the river.  ( Is the room you get teleported to.)

You can send a message : You are sucked in a whirlpool. And this will
be shown when the teleport happens.


To add a teleport message, add an extra description to the room
with keyword _tele_, and make the descript part be what you want
the message to be. 

Simple? Any question ask me about them.....
