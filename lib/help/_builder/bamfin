BAMFIN BAMFOUT

This changes the message displayed when a god does a goto either to or from
a room.  Syntax is : BAMFIN [text] or BAMFOUT [text]

Additionally, ~N can be used to insert your name, and ~H will insert
his/her as appropriate.  If you use def as keyword, it will revert to
the default text.
