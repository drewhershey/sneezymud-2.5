VOLUME

The old method of "you have x items in inventory and can carry a total
of: x" has been scrapped as being non-realistic.  In its place is a
more realistic system whereby each item is evaluated for its volume.
Roughly, the values shold relate to cubic inches of displacement.
Hence, a sword has a volume = 2000 and displaces 2000 cu. inches of
space. (45" x 4" x 11" roughly)

Bags and other container types are also rated for their volume capacity
as well as their weight capacity now.  Since all items have had their
material type rated in addition (wood, cloth, metal, etc).  We have
divised a "compaction" scheme.  Putting a metal breast plate in a bag
will not allow much folding and compacting of the metal, however, stuffing
a scroll or folding up a robe might allow its volume to be compressed
a great deal.

A player's volume capacity is directly related to his dexterity.  It is
also related to how "tied up" he is with other item manipulations.  Wielding
weapons, carrying shields, holding stuff in your hand is going to reduce
the total volume carryable a substantial amount.
 
Lastly, corpses of monsters occupy a set volume.  As you wouldn't expect
to be able to pick up a dragon's corpse due it's immense size, mob corpses
now are of appropriate volume.

Forthcoming spells may help alleviate some of the difficulty that this
presents.  But since no human being could be expected to carry 2 complete
changes of armor while wearing a third and totally decked out for combat,
this code is designed to prevent unrealistic pack ratting and hoarding of 
items.
