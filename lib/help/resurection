Accumulative: -
Duration    : Instantaneous

	Resurrect will attempt to return life to a corpse.  If successful,
the corpse will come back to life in a stunned state and have 1 hit point.
In some cases, the monster will be so grateful that it will become your 
(pet) for a period of 36 hours although most mobs will feel no compuction
to help you for your generosity.  Regardless, there is a charge of 10,000
coins to cast this spell.  It is only possible to cast this on the corpse
of a monster.
