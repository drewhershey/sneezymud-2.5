GAIN

  Whenever you have accumulated the experience points needed to get your
next level, you must go to your guildmaster and GAIN.  This will advance
you to your next level, give you your hit points, practices, and modify your
abilities (such as THAC0 or backstab multiplier).  Until you GAIN, you may
not gain any more experience points than those needed to place you one away
from the next highest level.
