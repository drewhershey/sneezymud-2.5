ASSIST

  If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same
person the <player> is.

  ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting.
It is better than KILL in many cases because you do not have to choose
between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered the room).
Even though monsters of the same type assist each other in combat,
ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one aggressor much faster.

  Also, assist has the advantage of, that should the person you are assisting 
flee, recall, or die, you will immediately stop fighting.
