RETREAT

This skill assists a monk or thief to leave a battle in a more
organized fashion then flee.  Every time you flee, your retreat score will
be checked.  If retreat succeeds, you will retreat from battle (thus
losing no experience) rather then flee.  Success of retreat obviously depends
on how well the skill is learned.  

This skill is automatically applied every time you flee; retreat is not
a recognized command.
