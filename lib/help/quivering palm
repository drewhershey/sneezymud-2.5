QUIVERING PALM
Monk Only.
 
  Quivering palm is a fabled monk attack.  It can only be done 1 time per
week, and only on an opponent of the same level or lower, with less than
2*the monks max hit points.   If the roll is successful, the target dies
instantly.  It requires intense training to develop this skill; you must
be a 30th level monk to even attempt it.
